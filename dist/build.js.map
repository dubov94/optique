После смерти Сэма Джек начал длительную борьбу за контроль над компанией со своими старшими братьями, Гарри и Альбертом Уорнерами. Он получил эксклюзивный контроль над фильмами, выпускаемыми компанией, в 1950, когда тайно купил акции своих братьев в бизнесе, убедив их принять участие в совместной продаже акций.

Studios in Burbank, California. Warner’s career spanned some forty-five years, its duration surpassing that of any other of the seminal Hollywood studio moguls. As co-head of production at Warner Bros. Studios, he worked with his brother, Sam Warner, to procure the technology for the film industry’s first talking picture. After Sam’s death, Jack clashed with his surviving older brothers, Harry and Albert Warner. He assumed exclusive control of the film production company in the 1950s, when he secretly purchased his brothers’ shares in the business after convincing them to participate in a joint sale of stocks. Although Warner was feared by many of his employees and inspired ridicule with his uneven attempts at humor, he earned respect for his shrewd instincts and tough-mindedness. He recruited many of Warner Bros.’ top stars and promoted the hard-edged social dramas for which the studio became known. Given to decisiveness, Warner once commented, “If I’m right fifty-one percent of the time, I’m ahead of the game.” Throughout his career, he was viewed as a contradictory and enigmatic figure. Although he was a staunch Republican, Warner encouraged film projects that promoted the agenda of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. He opposed European fascism and criticized Nazi Germany well before America’s involvement in World War II. An opponent of Communism, after the war Warner appeared as a friendly witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee, voluntarily naming screenwriters who had been fired as suspected Communists or sympathizers.

His parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland who spoke mainly Yiddish. Jack was the fifth surviving son of Benjamin Warner  a cobbler from Krasnosielc, Poland (then located in the Congress Kingdom), and his wife, the former Pearl Leah Eichelbaum.  Following their marriage in 1876, the couple had three children in Poland, one of whom died at a young age.  One of the surviving children was Jack’s eldest brother, Hirsch (later Harry).  The Warner family had occupied a “hostile world”, where the “night-riding of cossacks, the burning of houses, and the raping of women were part of life’s burden for the Jews of the ‘shtetl’”.  In 1888, in search of a better future for his family and himself, Benjamin made his way to Hamburg, Germany, and then took a ship to America. The Warner surname was perhaps originally “Wonsal” or “Wonskolaser”  Upon arriving in New York City, Benjamin introduced himself as “Benjamin Warner”, and the surname “Warner” remained with him for the rest of his life.  Pearl Warner and the couple’s two children joined him in Baltimore, Maryland, less than a year later. In Baltimore, the couple had five more children, including Abraham (later known as Albert) and Sam Warner.\\nBenjamin Warner’s decision to move to Canada in the early 1890s was inspired by a friend’s advice that he could make an excellent living bartering tin wares with trappers in exchange for furs.  Their sons Jack and David were born in Ontario.  After two arduous years in Canada, Benjamin and Pearl Warner returned to Baltimore, bringing along their growing family.  Two more children, Sadie and Milton, were added to the household there.  In 1896, the family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, following the lead of Harry Warner, who established a shoe repair shop in the heart of the emerging industrial town.  Benjamin worked with his son Harry in the shoe repair shop until he secured a loan to open a meat counter and grocery store in the city’s downtown area. \\nJack spent much of his youth in Youngstown. He observed in his autobiography that his experiences there molded his sensibilities. Warner wrote: “J. Edgar Hoover told me that Youngstown in those days was one of the toughest cities in America, and a gathering place for Sicilian thugs active in the Mafia. There was a murder or two almost every Saturday night in our neighborhood, and knives and brass knuckles were standard equipment for the young hotheads on the prowl.”  Warner claimed that he briefly belonged to a street gang based at Westlake’s Crossing, a notorious neighborhood located just west of the city’s downtown area.  Meanwhile, he received his first taste of show business in the burgeoning steel town, singing at local theaters and forming a brief business partnership with another aspiring “song-and-dance man”.  During his brief career in vaudeville, he officially changed his name to Jack Leonard Warner. Jack’s older brother Sam disapproved of these youthful pursuits. “Get out front where they pay the actors,” Sam Warner advised Jack. “That’s where the money is.”\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Early business ventures\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nIn Youngstown, the Warner brothers took their first tentative steps into the entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, Sam Warner formed a business partnership with another local resident and “took over” the city’s Old Grand Opera House, which he used as a venue for “cheap vaudeville and photoplays”.  The venture failed after one summer. Sam Warner then secured a job as a projectionist at Idora Park, a local amusement park. He convinced the family of the new medium’s possibilities and negotiated the purchase of a Model B Kinetoscope from a projectionist who was “down on his luck”.  The purchase price was $1,000,  and Jack Warner contributed $150 to the venture by pawning a horse, according to his obituary. \\nThe enterprising brothers screened a well-used copy of The Great Train Robbery throughout Ohio and Pennsylvania before renting a vacant store in New Castle, Pennsylvania.  This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker.  Jack, who was still living in Youngstown at the time, arrived on weekends “to sing illustrated song-slides during reel changes”.  In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907.  That year, the Warner brothers established the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement Company, a distribution firm that proved lucrative until the advent of Thomas Edison’s Motion Picture Patents Company (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees.  In 1909, Harry agreed to bring Jack into the family business; he sent his younger brother to Norfolk, Virginia, where Jack assisted Sam in the operation of a second film exchange company.  Later that year, the Warners sold the family business to the General Film Company for “$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period for a total of $52,000”  (equivalent to $1,371,837 today).\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Formation of Warner Bros.\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nThe Warner brothers pooled their resources and moved into film production in 1910.  Then, in 1912, they lent their support to filmmaker Carl Laemmle’s Independent Motion Picture Company, which challenged the monopolistic control of the Edison Trust. That same year, Jack Warner acquired a job as a film splicer in New York, where he assisted brother Sam with the production of the film Dante’s Inferno.  Despite the film’s success at the box office, Harry Warner remained concerned about the economic threat presented by the Edison Trust. He subsequently broke with Laemmle and sent Jack to establish a film exchange in San Francisco, while Sam did the same in Los Angeles.  The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market.  In 1917, Jack was sent to Los Angeles to open another film exchange company.  Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for My Four Years in Germany, a bestselling novel that condemned German wartime atrocities. The film proved to be a commercial and critical success,  and the four brothers were able to establish a studio in California.  In the new studio, Jack became co-head of production along with his older brother, Sam.  In this capacity, the two brothers secured new scripts and story lines, managed film production, and looked for ways to reduce production costs.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Hollywood movie studios, 1922\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nWarner Bros. followed up the success of My Four Years in Germany with a popular serial titled The Tiger’s Claw in 1919. That same year, the studio was less successful in its efforts to promote Open Your Eyes, a tract on the dangers of venereal disease that featured Jack Warner’s sole screen appearance.  During this period, the studio earned few profits;  and in 1920, the Warners secured a bank loan to settle outstanding debts.  Shortly thereafter, the Warners relocated their production studio from Culver City, California, to Hollywood, where they purchased a lot on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Bronson Avenue,  known today as Sunset Bronson Studios. The new location and upgraded facilities did not significantly improve the studio’s image, which remained defined by its low-budget comedies and racy films on declining morality. \\nThe studio discovered a trained German Shepherd named Rin Tin Tin in 1923. The canine made his debut in Where the North Begins, a film about an abandoned pup who is raised by wolves and befriends a fur trapper.  According to one biographer, Jack Warner’s initial doubts about the project were quelled when he met Rin Tin Tin, “who seemed to display more intelligence than some of the Warner comics.”  Rin Tin Tin proved to be the studio’s most important commercial asset until the introduction of sound.  Screenwriter Darryl F. Zanuckproduced several scripts for Rin Tin Tin vehicles and, during one year, wrote more than half of the studio’s features.  Between 1928 and 1933, Zanuck served as Jack Warner’s right-hand man and executive producer, a position whose responsibilities included the day-to-day production of films.  Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and other projects, however, Warner Bros. was unable to compete with Hollywood’s “Big Three” – Paramount, Universal, and First National studios. \\nIn 1925, the studio expanded its operations and acquired the Brooklyn-based theater company, Vitagraph.  Later that year, Sam Warner urged his brother, Harry, to sign an agreement with Western Electric to develop a series of talking “shorts” using the newly developed Vitaphone technology.  Sam died of pneumonia in 1927 (just before the premiere of the first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer),  and Jack became sole head of production.  Sam’s death left Jack inconsolable. One biographer writes, “Throughout his life, Jack had been warmed by Sam’s sunshiny optimism, his thirst for excitement, his inventive mind, his gambling nature. Sam had also served as a buffer between Jack and his stern eldest brother, Harry.  In the years to come, Jack ran the Warner Bros. Burbank studio with an iron hand. Following his brother’s death, he became increasingly difficult to deal with and inspired the resentment of many of his employees. \\nAs the family grieved over Sam’s sudden passing, the success of The Jazz Singer helped establish Warner Bros. as a major studio. While Warner Bros. invested only $500,000 in the film, the studio reaped $3 million in profits.  Hollywood’s five major studios, which controlled most of the nation’s movie theaters, initially attempted to block the growth of “talking pictures”.  In the face of such organized opposition, Warner Bros. produced 12 “talkies” in 1928 alone.  The following year, the newly formed Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Warner Bros. for “revolutionizing the industry with sound”. \\nDespite Warner Bros.’ new prosperity, Jack kept a tight rein on costs. He placed the studio’s directors on a quota system, and decreed a flat, low-key lighting style to make the sets look cheaper than they were.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Depression era\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nThe studio emerged relatively unscathed from the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and produced a broad range of films, including “backstage musicals,” “crusading biopics,” “swashbucklers,” and “women’s pictures.” As Thomas Schatz observed, this repertoire was “a means of stabilizing marketing and sales, of bringing efficiency and economy into the production of some fifty feature films per year, and of distinguishing Warners’ collective output from that of its competitors”.  Warner Bros. became best known, however, for its hard-hitting social dramas, whose production Jack Warner tended to support. These included gangster classics such as Little Caesar and The Public Enemy as well as the critically acclaimed I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, starring Paul Muni.  Some of these films reflected a surprising (albeit temporary) shift in Warner’s political outlook. By 1932, despite his longstanding association with the Republican Party, he openly supported Democratic presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt, staging a “Motion Picture and Electrical Parade Sports Pageant” at L.A. Stadium in Roosevelt’s honor. This development foreshadowed an “era in which Warner would recruit the most New Deal-ish (often simultaneously the most left-wing) writers”. \\nDuring this period, Warner took an active role in recruiting talent. To furnish Warner Bros. with much needed “star power”, he raided contract players from rival studios, in some cases offering to double their salaries. This strategy yielded three leading stars from Paramount Studios – William Powell, Kay Francis, and Ruth Chatterton. In 1929, Warner persuaded British stage and screen actor George Arliss to play the title role in a remake of the 1921 United Artists film Disraeli, a project that turned out to be a box-office hit.  Then, in 1930, he spotted future stars James Cagney, Joan Blondell, and Frank McHugh in the cast of a New York play called Penny Arcade.  Although Cagney turned out to be Warner’s greatest prize, he was also the studio executive’s biggest professional challenge.  During his frequent arguments with Warner, Cagney often resorted to screaming the Yiddish obscenities he learned during his upbringing in the Hell’s Kitchen district of New York City. According to a 1937 Fortune magazine article, Warner’s most intense contract disputes involved Cagney, “who got sick of being typed as a girl-hitting mick and of making five pictures a year instead of four.” \\nThe studio’s executive producer, Darryl F. Zanuck, resigned during a contract dispute with Harry Warner in 1933.  According to a 1933 letter that Jack wrote to Will H. Hays, then president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Zanuck requested a higher salary and “indicated his desire to raise the salaries of the actors and personnel in the motion pictures we were producing”.  That year, Zanuck established Twentieth Century Pictures, which merged with Fox Film Corporationin 1935.  Longtime producer for the studio, Hal B. Wallis, took over as the studio’s executive producer.  Warner, however, denied Wallis the sweeping powers enjoyed by Zanuck, and the result was a decentralization of creative and administrative control that often created confusion at the studio.  Under the new system, each picture was assigned a supervisor who was usually plucked from the ranks of the studio’s screenwriters.  Although Warner Bros. maintained a high rate of production throughout the 1930s, some pictures showed an uneven quality that reflected “not only the difficulty of shifting to a supervisory system but also the consequences of dispersing authority into the creative ranks”. \\nMeanwhile, Jack Warner’s role in production became somewhat limited. After acquiring a creative property, he often had little to do with a film’s production until it was ready for preview.  Nevertheless, Warner could be heavy-handed in his dealings with employees, and he was “merciless in his firings.”  Film director Gottfried Reinhardt claimed that Warner “derived pleasure” from humiliating subordinates.  “Harry Cohn was a sonofabitch,” Reinhardt said, “but he did it for business; he was not a sadist. [Louis B.] Mayer could be a monster, but he was not mean for the sake of meanness. Jack was.” \\nWarner’s management style frustrated many studio employees. Comedian Jack Benny, who once worked at Warner Bros., quipped, “Jack Warner would rather tell a bad joke than make a good movie”.  Warner frequently clashed with actors and supposedly banned them from the studio’s executive dining room, with the explanation, “I don’t need to look at actors when I eat.”  The studio executive did, however, win the affection of a few film personalities.\\nAmong these was Bette Davis, one of the studio’s leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract.  In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: “No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. The power. The glory. And he was in business to make money.”  Davis revealed that, after the birth of her child, Warner’s attitude toward her became warm and protective. “We became father and child, no question about it.” she said. “He told me I didn’t have to come back to work until I really felt like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him.”  Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time.  In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn’s contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"The prewar and war years\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nAs the 1930s came to an end, both Jack and Harry Warner became increasingly alarmed over the rise of Nazism.  As Bernard F. Dick observed, the Warners, “as sons of Polish Jews who fled their homeland because of antisemitic pogroms ... had a personal interest in exposing Nazism.” Moreover, the attraction to films critical of German militarism had a long history with the Warners that predated their production of My Four Years in Germany in 1918. In 1917, while it was still in distribution, the Warners had secured the rights for War Brides, a movie that featured Alla Nazimova as “a woman who kills herself rather than breed children for an unidentified country whose army looks suspiciously Teutonic.” \\nBeyond this, Jack Warner was shaken by the 1936 murder of studio salesman Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin.  Warner later described the incident in the following terms: “Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [Nazi hoodlums] hit him with fists and clubs and then kicked the life out of him with their boots and left him dying there.”  Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism and the loss of European markets, Warner Brothers produced films that were openly critical of Nazi Germany.\\nIn 1939, the studio published Confessions of a Nazi Spy, starring Edward G. Robinson. The film project, which was recommended to Jack Warner by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, drew on the real-life experiences of agent Leon G. Turrou, who had worked as an undercover agent.  Despite legal ramifications preventing the use of actual names, the studio aimed for an “aura of authenticity”, and Hal Wallis initially recommended eliminating credits to give the film “the appearance of a newsreel.” \\nConfessions of a Nazi Spy was widely criticized. The critic Pare Lorentz wrote, “The Warner brothers have declared war on Germany with this one.” The German ambassador responded by issuing a protest to Secretary of State Cordell Hull, and the German dictator, Adolf Hitler, who watched the film at Berchtesgaden, was outraged.  Meanwhile, the studio received stern warnings from U.S. Congressman Martin Dies, Jr., about defaming a “friendly country”. \\nInitially, the studio bowed to pressure from the Roosevelt Administration, the Hays Office, and isolationist lawmakers to desist from similar projects. Jack Warner announced that the studio would release no more “propaganda pictures” and promptly ordered the shelving of several projects with an anti-Nazi theme.  In time, however, Warner Bros. produced more films with anti-Nazi messages, including Underground and All Through the Night. In 1940, the studio produced short films that dramatically documented the devastation wrought by the German bombing raids on London. Meanwhile, the studio celebrated the exploits of the Royal Canadian Air Force, with films such as Captains of the Clouds.  In 1941, Warner also produced the influential prowar film Sergeant York. \\nContemporary reports that Jack Warner had banned the use of the German language throughout the company’s studios were denied by studio representatives who indicated that this move would have prevented scores of studio employees from communicating with each other. \\nAfter the American declaration of war against the Axis Powers, Jack Warner, like some other studio heads, was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army. \\nIn 1943 the studio’s film Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture. When the award was announced, producer Hal B. Wallis got up to accept, only to find Jack Warner had rushed onstage “with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction” to take the trophy, Wallis later recalled. “I couldn’t believe it was happening. Casablanca had been my creation; Jack had absolutely nothing to do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious. ... Almost forty years later, I still haven’t recovered from the shock.” \\nIn 1943, Warner, at the advice of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, produced a film adaptation of the controversial book Mission to Moscow,  a film intended to inspire public support of the uneasy military alliance that the United States had with the Soviet Union.  Later, while testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee on October 27, 1947,  Warner dismissed allegations during the Cold War that this film was subversive, and he argued that Mission to Moscow was produced “only to help a desperate war effort, and not for posterity.”  After the film’s lackluster response under distribution, the Republican National Committeeaccused Warner of producing it as “New Deal propaganda.” \\nIn line with the Warner brothers’ early opposition to Nazism, Warner Bros. produced more pictures about the war than any other studio, covering every branch of the armed services.  In addition, the studio produced patriotic musicals such as This is the Army and Yankee Doodle Dandy.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Postwar era\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nJack Warner responded grudgingly to the rising popularity of television in the late 1940s.  Initially, he tried to compete with the new medium, introducing gimmicks such as 3-D films, which soon lost their appeal among moviegoers.  In 1954, Warner finally engaged the new medium, providing ABC with a weekly show, Warner Bros. Presents.  The studio followed up with a series of Western dramas, such as Maverick, Bronco, and Colt .45.  Accustomed to dealing with actors in a high-handed manner, within a few years Warner provoked hostility among emerging TV stars like James Garner, who filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over a contract dispute.  He was angered by the perceived ingratitude of television actors, who evidently showed more independence than film actors, and this deepened his contempt for the new medium.  Following his deal with ABC, Warner also made his son, Jack Jr., head of the company’s new television department. \\nDuring this period, Warner showed little foresight in his treatment of the studio’s cartoon operation. Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, “were always stepchildren at Warner Bros.”  As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, “Jack Warner...considered cartoons no more than an extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers.”  In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio’s cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn’t “even know where the hell the cartoon studio is”, and Harry added, “The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse,” a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions.  Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece. As Thomas noted, “They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros.” \\nJack Warner’s tumultuous relationship with his brother, Harry, worsened in February 1956, when Harry learned of Jack’s decision to sell the Warner Bros.’ pre-1950 sound films to Associated Artists Productions (soon to merge with United Artists Television) for the modest sum of $21 million.  (The deal did not include the black-and-white Looney Tunes films, the first Merrie Melodie film, Lady, Play Your Mandolin!, and the color cartoons released between August 1, 1948, and the close of 1949. The black-and-white cartoons and the silent films were sold to the Guild Films company under license of Sunset Productions, which was established by Warners as its television subsidiary in the same manner as the Columbia Pictures subsidiary “Screen Gems”, and the aforementioned color cartoons of 1948-49 remained with Warner Brothers). \\n“This is our heritage, what we worked all our lives to create, and now it is gone,” Harry exclaimed, upon hearing of the deal.  The breach between Jack and Harry widened later that year. In July 1956, Jack, Harry, and Albert announced that they were putting Warner Bros. on the market.  Jack, however, secretly organized a syndicate that purchased control of the company.  By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother’s dealings, it was too late. \\nJack Warner, as the company’s largest stockholder, appointed himself as the new company president.  Shortly after the deal was closed, Jack Warner announced that the company and its subsidiaries would be “directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties, talents, and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible”. \\nThe two brothers had often argued, and earlier in the decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, “I’ll get you for this, you son of a bitch” and threatening to kill him.  This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again.  When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d’Antibes.  Asked to respond to his brother’s death, Jack said, “I didn’t give a shit about Harry.”  At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"The Sixties\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nIn the 1960s, Warner kept pace with rapid changes in the industry and played a key role in developing films that were commercial and critical successes. In February 1962, he purchased the film rights for the Broadway musical My Fair Lady, paying an unprecedented $6.5 million. The previous owner, CBS director William S. Paley, set terms that included 50 percent of the distributor’s gross profits “plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract.”  Despite the “outrageous” purchase price, and the ungenerous terms of the contract, the deal proved lucrative for Warner Bros., securing the studio $12 million in profits. Warner was criticized for choosing a non-singing star, Audrey Hepburn, to play the leading role of Eliza Doolittle; indeed, the 1964 Academy Award for Best Actress went to Julie Andrews, who had played Eliza on Broadway and in London, for Mary Poppins, while Audrey Hepburn was not even nominated. However, the film won the best-picture Academy Award for 1964. \\nIn 1965, Warner surprised many industry observers when he purchased the rights to Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee’s searing play about a destructive marriage.  From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy. Ernest Lehman’s script, which was extremely faithful to Albee’s play, stretched the U.S. film industry’s Production Code to the limit.  Jack Valenti, who just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him “uneasy”.  “I was uncomfortable with the thought that this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight,” Valenti wrote.  Meanwhile, Lehman and the film’s director, Mike Nichols, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white.  These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an “Adults only” label and restrict tickets sales accordingly, all as a marketing tease to entice audiences to see what warranted that restriction. At this, the MPAA — wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film, The Pawnbroker — gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively.  Upon its release, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was embraced by audiences and critics alike. It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966. \\nDespite these achievements, Jack grew weary of making films, and he sold a substantial amount of his studio stock to Seven Arts Productions on November 14, 1966.  Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.’s executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio.  Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement. His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to “slow down”, and the aging studio head felt a need to put his affairs in order.  Warner sold his 1.6 million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of Lerner & Loewe’s Camelot.  The sale yielded, after capital gains taxes, about $24 million  (equivalent to $171 million today). Eight months after the sale, Warner quipped, “Who would ever have thought that a butcher boy from Youngstown, Ohio, would end up with twenty-four million smackers in his pocket?”  At the time of the sale, Warner had earned the distinction of being the second chief to also serve as company president, after Columbia Pictures’ Harry Cohn.\\nWarner’s decision to sell came at a time when he was losing the formidable power that he once took for granted. He had already survived the dislocations of the 1950s, when other studio heads – including Louis B. Mayer, David O. Selznick, and Samuel Goldwyn – were pushed out by stockholders who “sought scapegoats for dwindling profits”.  Structural changes that occurred in the industry during this period ensured that studios would become “more important as backers of independent producers than as creators of their own films”, a situation that left little room for the traditional movie mogul.  By the mid-1960s, most of the film moguls from the Golden Age of Hollywood had died, and Warner was regarded as one of the last of a dying breed. Evidence of Warner’s eroding control at Warner Bros. included his failure to block production of the controversial but highly influential film, Bonnie and Clyde, a film project he initially “hated”.  Similarly, as producer of the film adaptation of Camelot, Warner was unable to persuade director Joshua Logan to cast Richard Burton and Julie Andrews in the leading roles. Instead, Logan selected Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave, a move that contributed to the project’s critical – and commercial – failure.  Another factor was that Logan was able to manipulate Warner’s ego to persuade him from cutting the screenplay’s length, despite the fact that the studio executive had already agreed with the film’s unofficial producer, Joel Freeman, that it was overlong.  Warner officially retired from his studio in 1969.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"After Warner Bros.\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nWarner remained active as an independent producer until the early 1970s. to run some of the company’s distributions and exhibition division.  Among his last productions was a film adaptation of a Broadway musical, 1776, which was released through Columbia Pictures.  Before the film’s release, Warner showed a preview cut to U.S. President Richard Nixon, who recommended substantial changes, including the removal of the song ‘Cool, Cool, Considerate Men’ that struck him as veiled criticisms of the ongoing Vietnam War.  Without consulting the film’s director, Peter H. Hunt, Warner ordered the film re-edited.  The cuts have since been restored in most television showings and in the film’s DVD release.\\nIn November 1972, the film opened to enthusiastic audiences at Radio City Music Hall, but it fared poorly in theaters.  Faced with a polarized political climate, few Americans were drawn to “a cheery exercise in prerepublic civics”.  Warner’s efforts to promote the film were sometimes counterproductive. During an interview with talk show host Merv Griffin, the elderly producer engaged in a lengthy tirade against “pinko communists”.

Irma Warner gave birth to the couple’s only child, Jack M. Warner on March 27, 1916. Jack Warner named the child after himself, disregarding an Ashkenazi Jewish custom that children should not be named after living relatives. Although his son bore a different middle initial, he “has been called Junior all his life”.  The marriage ended in 1935, when Warner left his wife for another woman, Ann Page. Warner and Ann had a daughter named Barbara.   Irma Warner sued her husband for divorce (a scandalous move at the time) on the grounds of desertion. Jack’s older brother, Harry, reflected the Warner family feelings about the marriage when he exclaimed, “Thank God our mother didn’t live to see this”. Warner married Ann after the divorce. The Warners, who took Irma’s side in the affair, refused to accept Ann as a family member. In the wake of this falling out, Jack’s relationship with his son, Jack Warner Jr., also became strained. \\nIn the late 1950s, Warner was almost killed in a car accident that left him in a coma for several days. On August 5, 1958, after an evening of baccarat at the Palm Beach Casino in Cannes, Warner’s Alfa Romeo roadster swerved into the path of a coal truck on a stretch of road located near the seaside villa of Prince Aly Khan. Warner was thrown from the car, which burst into flames upon impact. Shortly after the accident, his son, Jack Jr., joined other family members in France, where the unconscious studio head was hospitalized. In an interview with reporters, Jack Jr. suggested that his father was dying. Then, during a visit to his father’s hospital room, the young man offended Ann Warner, whom he largely blamed for his parents’ divorce. When Warner regained consciousness, he was enraged by reports of his son’s behavior, and their “tenuous” relationship came to an end. On December 30, 1958, Jack Jr. was informed, by Jack Sr.’s lawyer Arnold Grant, that the elder Warner had released him from the company. When he attempted to report for work, studio guards denied him entry. The two men never achieved a reconciliation, and Jack Jr. is not mentioned in his father’s 1964 autobiography. Warner made no pretense of faithfulness to his wife, Ann, and kept a series of mistresses throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The most enduring of these “girlfriends” was an aspiring actress named Jackie Park, who bore a “startling” resemblance to Warner’s second wife. The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann Warner pressed her husband to terminate the affair. Although Ann did once have an affair with studio actor Eddie Albert in 1941, she was much more devoted to the marriage by contrast In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Jack Warner had a softer side. In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Warner on his 1964 autobiography, My First Hundred Years in Hollywood, Ann Warner wrote: “He is extremely sensitive, but there are few who know that because he covers it with a cloak.” \\nAn “ardent Republican”, Jack Warner nevertheless supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal in the early 1930s.  Later in the decade, he made common cause with opponents of Nazi Germany, overlooking ideological differences with those who held leftist political views.  In 1947, however, Warner served as a “friendly witness” for the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), thereby lending support to allegations of a “Red” infiltration of Hollywood.  Warner felt that Communists were responsible for the studio’s month-long strike that occurred in the fall of 1946, and on his own initiative, he provided the names of a dozen screenwriters who were dismissed because of suspected Communist sympathies, a move that effectively destroyed their careers.  Former studio employees named by Warner included Alvah Bessie, Howard Koch, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Robert Rossen, Dalton Trumbo, Clifford Odets, and Irwin Shaw. As one biographer observed, Warner “was furious when Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Paul Henreid and John Huston joined other members of the stellar Committee for the First Amendment in a flight to Washington to preach against the threat to free expression”. Lester D. Friedman noted that Warner’s response to the HUAC hearings was similar to other Jewish studio heads who “feared that a blanket equation of Communists with Jews would destroy them and their industry”.\\nWarner publicly supported Richard Nixon during the 1960 presidential election and paid for full-page ads in The New York Times “to proclaim why Nixon should be elected”. In the wake of Nixon’s loss to John F. Kennedy, however, the studio head made arrangements to attend a fundraiser at the Los Angeles Palladium in honor of the president-elect. Several weeks later, Warner received a phone call from the new chief executive’s father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and within a short time, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights for Robert Donovan’s book, PT 109, a bestseller concerning John Kennedy’s exploits during World War II. “I don’t think President Kennedy would object to my friendship with Dick Nixon,” Warner said later. “I would have voted for both of them if I could. You might think this is a form of fence-straddling, but I love everybody.” In the late 1960s, he emerged as an outspoken proponent of the Vietnam War.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Death and legacy\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nBy the end of 1973, those closest to Warner became aware of signs that he was becoming disoriented. Shortly after losing his way in the building that housed his office, Warner retired. In 1974, Warner suffered a stroke that left him blind and enfeebled. During the next several years, he gradually lost the ability to speak, and became unresponsive to friends and relatives. Finally, on August 13, 1978, Warner was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he died of a heart inflammation (edema) on September 9. He was 86 years old. A funeral service was held at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the synagogue to which many members of the Warner family belonged. He was interred at Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California. \\nJack Warner left behind an estate estimated at $15 million. Much of the Warner estate, including property and memorabilia, was bequeathed to his widow, Ann. Warner, however, left $200,000 to his estranged son, Jack Jr., perhaps in an effort to discourage him from contesting the will. In the days following Warner’s death, newspaper obituaries recounted the familiar story of “the four brothers who left the family butcher shop for nickelodeons” and went on to revolutionize American cinema. A front-page story in Warner’s adopted hometown of Youngstown featured accounts of the family’s pre-Hollywood struggles in Ohio, describing how Jack Warner drove a wagon for his father’s business when he was only seven years old. The late movie [mogul] was widely eulogized for his role in “shaping Hollywood’s ‘Golden Age’”.\\nSeveral months after Warner’s death, a more personal tribute was organized by the Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California. The event, called “The Colonel: An Affectionate Remembrance of Jack L. Warner”, drew Hollywood notables such as entertainers Olivia de Havilland and Debbie Reynolds, and cartoon voice actor Mel Blanc. Blanc closed the event with a rendition of Porky Pig’s famous farewell, “A-bee-a-bee-a-bee–that’s all, folks.” In recognition of his contributions to the motion picture industry, Jack Warner was accorded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard.

The Praxinoscope replaced the narrow viewing slits of the Zoetrope with an inner circle of 12 mirrors (equal to the number of images), allowing a clearer and less distorted view of the moving image. Several people could watch the performance at the same time. After Reynaud licensed his invention in 1877, it sold well in a number of the large Paris department stores.\\nIn 1878, Reynaud produced the Praxinoscope Theatre. This improved version included a glass viewing screen which allowed the moving image to be superimposed over a changeable background.

In the early 1890s he built a film camera along with Emil, and in 1895 the brothers produced the Bioskop. The Bioskop, which was inspired by magic-lantern technology, used two loops of 54mm film, one frame being projected alternately from each.

Aoki was later adopted by another uncle Aoki Toshio and relocated to San Francisco. Toshio worked as a sketch artist for a local newspaper. Tsuru Aoki started taking lessons in ballet dance in New York, when she went along with her uncle Toshio, who was hired by David Belasco for The Darling of the Gods. After Toshio’s death a reporter looked after Aoki.  Aoki began her acting career after returning to Los Angeles and performing in stage productions in the city’s Japanese Theatre where she was noticed by film producer Thomas Ince who placed the young actress under contract. She was also responsible for recruiting Japanese actors for Imperial Japanese Company, a subsidiary of New York Motion Picture Corporation.  Aoki made her film debut in the Majestic film studios release The Oath of Tsuru San in 1913 opposite actor William Garwood. Her follow-up film was the 1914 Ince produced O Mimi San, which starred the American child actress Mildred Harris and a handsome young newcomer named Sessue Hayakawa, whom Aoki had acted with onstage at the Japanese Theatre the previous year. The couple began a romantic relationship that would culminate in their marriage on May 1, 1914, just weeks before the release of their critically acclaimed and publicly successful film The Wrath of the Gods – a melodrama about an interracial romance between a man portrayed by Caucasian actor/director Frank Borzage and an Asian woman portrayed by Aoki. The film also starred Sessue Hayakawa and featured actress Gladys Brockwell. Hayakawa and Aoki would eventually make more than twenty films together throughout the 1910s and 1920s.\\nOne of Aoki’s most recalled films of the silent period is the 1919 William Worthington-directed The Dragon Painter, in which Aoki starred, playing a young woman who convinces an isolated, mentally deranged artist named Tatsu (portrayed by Hayakawa) to come down from the mountains so that she may civilize him and he may further his artistic abilities. Other notable films of the period were The Typhoon (1914), The Vigil (1914), The Geisha (1914), The Chinatown Mystery (1915), His Birthright (1918), and The Breath of the Gods (1920). Throughout the 1910s, Aoki would appear in approximately forty films, often in leading-lady roles which was a first for an Asian actress. Some of her co-stars of the era included such notable names as Marin Sais, Frank Borzage, Gladys Brockwell, Mildred Harris, Jack Holt, Jane Wolfe, Dagmar Godowsky, Vola Vale, Florence Vidor, Earle Foxe, and Walter Long. After a series of moderately successful Ince-produced two-reel serials, Aoki’s career in the United States began to falter (while her husband’s career began to build momentum), and the couple travelled to France in 1923 and filmed the popular Édouard-Émile Violet-directed drama La Bataille. After returning to America, however, Aoki made only three more films before retiring from the screen to raise her and Hayakawa’s three adopted children. Her last silent screen performance was the 1924 release The Danger Line. Aoki would only return to the screen in 1960 (her first talkie) to once again appear with her husband in the drama Hell to Eternity.

На экранах Мэйбл Норманд часто появлялась с такими комедийными мэтрами, как Гарольд Ллойд, Чарли Чаплин и Роско Арбакл.\\nВ 1914 году, на пике своей карьеры, Мэйбл Норманд снялась в таких знаменитых немых фильмах, как «Необыкновенно затруднительное положение Мэйбл», «Настигнутый в кабаре», «Деловой день Мэйбл» и «Состоявшееся знакомство».\\nВ 1918 году, после расставания с Саннетом, Мэйбл подписала контракт с кинопродюсером Сэмюэлем Голдуином на съёмки в кино за $3 500 в неделю, а позже открыла свою собственную киностудию в калифорнийском городе Калвер-сити.\\nВ начале 1920-х годов Мэйбл стала близкой подругой актёра и режиссёра Уильяма Дезмонда Тейлора. 1 февраля 1922 года, спустя несколько минут после того, как Норманд покинула его дом, Тейлор был убит. Полиция много допрашивала актрису по этому делу, но всё же она никогда не была под подозрением Мэйбл хорошо досталось от газетчиков, которые даже по прошествии времени продолжали обсуждать это убийство, её связь с Тейлором, а также возможные пристрастия актрисы к наркотикам.\\nСпустя пару лет, в 1924 году, Мэйбл Норманд опять стала главной темой для обсуждения в газетах — её шофёр Джо Келли ранил из пистолета крупного нефтяника-миллионера Кортленда С. Дайнеса, который в то время встречался с подругой Мэйбл актрисой Эдной Пёрвиэнс.\\nНесмотря на множество сплетен и нападок в свой адрес, Мэйбл продолжала сниматься в кино, а в 1926 году подписала контракт со студией «Hal Roach Studios». В том же году Норманд вышла замуж за актёра Лью Коуди, с которым снималась вместе в фильме «Микки» в 1918 году, а также была соседкой по дому в Беверли-Хиллз. В то же время у актрисы начались проблемы со здоровьем, вызванные туберкулёзом. Из-за этого ей пришлось распрощаться с кино и много времени провести в санатории. Несмотря на усердие врачей актрису спасти не удалось, и 23 февраля 1930 года в возрасте 37 лет Мэйбл Норманд умерла.\\nЗа свой вклад в киноиндустрию Мэйбл Норманд удостоена звезды на Голливудской аллее славы.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Интересные факты\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nСчитается что именно Мэйбл Норманд является автором номера с запусканием кремового пирога в лицо.

Dines, who was shot by Normand’s chauffeur using her pistol. She was not a suspect in either crime.

Normand’s mother was of Irish heritage, while her father was French Canadian.  Her father Claude Normand was employed as a cabinet maker and stage carpenter at Sailors’ Snug Harbor home for elderly seamen. Before she entered films at age 16 in 1909, Normand worked as an artist’s model, which included posing for postcards illustrated by Charles Dana Gibson, creator of the Gibson Girl image, as well as for Butterick’s clothing pattern manufacturers in lower Manhattan. For a short time, she worked for Vitagraph Studios in New York City for $25 per week, but Vitagraph founder Albert E. Smith admitted she was one of several actresses about whom he made a mistake in estimating their “potential for future stardom.”  Her quietly effervescent lead performance, while directed by D. W. Griffith in the dramatic 1911 short film Her Awakening, drew attention and she met director Mack Sennett while at Griffith’s Biograph Company. She embarked on a topsy-turvy relationship with him; he later brought her across to California when he founded Keystone Studios in 1912. Her earlier Keystone films portrayed her as a bathing beauty but Normand quickly demonstrated a flair for comedy and became a major star of Sennett’s short films. Normand appeared with Charles Chaplin and Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle in many short films as well as Oliver Hardy, Stan Laurel, and Boris Karloff.\\nShe played a key role in starting Chaplin’s film career and acted as his leading lady and mentor in a string of films in 1914, sometimes co-writing and directing or co-directing films with him. Chaplin had considerable initial difficulty adjusting to the demands of film acting and his performance suffered for it. After his first film appearance in Making a Living, Sennett felt he had made a costly mistake.  Most historians agree it was Normand who persuaded him to give Chaplin another chance,  and she and Chaplin appeared together in a dozen subsequent films, almost always as a couple in the lead roles. In 1914, she starred with Marie Dressler and Chaplin in Tillie’s Punctured Romance, the first feature-length comedy. Earlier that same year, in January/February, Chaplin first played his Tramp character in Mabel’s Strange Predicament, although it wound up being the second Tramp film released; Chaplin offers an account of his experience on the film in his autobiography. \\nShe opened her own company in partnership with Mack Sennett 1916. It was based in Culver City and was a subsidiary of the Triangle Film Corperation. She lost the company in 1918 when Triangle experienced a massive shake up which also saw Sennett lose Keystone and establish his own independent studio.\\nIn 1918, as her relationship with Sennett came to an end, Normand signed a $3,500 per week contract with Samuel Goldwyn.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Taylor’s murder\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nDirector William Desmond Taylor shared her interest in books, and the two formed a close relationship. According to author Robert Giroux, Taylor was deeply in love with Normand, who had originally approached him for help in curing her cocaine dependency. Based upon Normand’s subsequent statements to investigators, her repeated relapses were devastating for Taylor. According to Giroux, Taylor met with federal prosecutors shortly before his death and offered to assist them in filing charges against Normand’s cocaine suppliers. Giroux expresses a belief that Normand’s suppliers learned of this meeting and hired a contract killer to murder the director. According to Giroux, Normand suspected the reasons for Taylor’s murder, but did not know the identity of the man who killed him.According to Kevin Brownlow and John Kobal in their book Hollywood The Pioneers the idea that Taylor was murdered by drug dealers was invented by the studio for publicity purposes.  There is no evidence that Normand was an addict, despite the fact that this is often repeated as if it were established fact.\\nOn the night of his murder, February 1, 1922, Normand left Taylor’s bungalow at 7:45 p.m. in a happy mood, carrying a book he had lent her. They blew kisses to each other as her limousine drove away. Normand was the last person known to have seen Taylor alive. The Los Angeles Police Department subjected Normand to a grueling interrogation, but ruled her out as a suspect.  Most subsequent writers have done the same.

By the time Dreyer watched her act in an amateur theater and selected her as his leading lady in his upcoming production La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc, she was already a celebrated stage artiste, and had appeared in one film, La Comtesse de Somerive (1917), directed by Georges Denola and Jean Kemm. Falconetti was 35 years old when she played the role of 19-year-old Joan of Arc in La Passion. Her portrayal is widely considered one of the most astonishing performances ever committed to film, and it would remain her final cinematic role.\\nMany writers have claimed that Falconetti’s performance was the result of extreme cruelty at the hands of Dreyer, a notoriously demanding director who pushed her to the brink of emotional collapse. For example, film critic Roger Ebert writes,\\nFor Falconetti, the performance was an ordeal. Legends from the set tell of Dreyer forcing her to kneel painfully on stone and then wipe all expression from her face – so that the viewer would read suppressed or inner pain. He filmed the same shots again and again, hoping that in the editing room he could find exactly the right nuance in her facial expression. \\nHowever, in their biography of Dreyer, Jean and Dale Drum say that these stories are based only on rumour and that “there is no evidence that Dreyer could be called a sadist”.  They quote onlookers who described Dreyer’s working relationship with Falconetti: initially in the production process, “Dreyer and Falconetti would watch the rushes of a single scene together, seven or eight times, until Dreyer could pick out a little bit, maybe a few feet, where the effect was what they wanted, and when they reshot the scene, she could play it without the least inhibition. Just those few feet of film had inspired her.” Later, Falconetti became able to play scenes only from Dreyer’s explanations, without the need even for rehearsal. \\nSubsequent career \\nAfter filming Joan of Arc, Falconetti continued with her career as a producer of light stage comedies, appearing with the Comédie-Française. During the Second World War, she escaped from France first to Switzerland, and then left for Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Falconetti had suffered from mental illness all her life, and in 1946 she died in Brazil, allegedly due to a self-imposed restrictive diet after having become significantly overweight.  Her remains are interred at Montmartre Cemetery in Paris.

During a dance routine, Weixler collapsed on stage and the show had to be closed. Various speculations were cast by the press for her ailment, including stress or a neurological disorder. The filming of a new movie had to be aborted because of her poor health after her collapse. Later that year Weixler was given morphine, to which she became addicted. She was placed in a sanatorium in Berlin for rest and recovery. On 30 November 1916, aged 24, she committed suicide by hanging herself. She was buried at the Südwestkirchhof cemetery in Stahnsdorf in December of that year. In 1921, five years after her death, Dorittchens Vergnügungsreise (Dorritchen’s Pleasure Cruise) was released to the German public.

Его отец, Оливер Харви, был ветераном Гражданской войны в США, участником сражения при Энтитеме, а мать, Эмили Норвел, была представительницей старейшей семьи в штате, а среди её предков был капитан Хью Норвел, участвовавший ещё в колониальных войнах в XVIII веке. Норвел был самым младшим из пяти детей в семье, а менее чем через год после его рождения, глава семейства умер.\\nСмерть отца всё же не оставила семью без средств к существованию, так как их мать была успешной владелицей отеля. Будучи ещё мальчишкой, Норвел был отправлен в военную академию в соседний город Милледжвилль, где пробыл до 13 лет. В 1905 году он поступил в методистский колледж в город Янг-Харрис на севере Джорджии, где получил среднее образование. Интереса к получению знаний он не испытывал, зато с юных лет увлекался музыкой и театром. Его мать поддерживала увлечения сына и отправила его в школу-интернат в Атланту, чтобы изучать пение и музыку. Но Норвел часто пропускал занятие и в итоге сбежал из школы и присоединился к странствующей театральной группе. Где-то в 1910 году, в знак уважения к отцу, Норвел прибавил к своему имени имя Оливер, став именоваться Оливер Норвел Харви, а впоследствии и вовсе стал использовать имя отца как собственное.\\nПосле недолгого участия в театральной группе Оливер вернулся в Милледжвилль, где устроился на работу в недавно открывшийся кинотеатр, в котором совмещал обязанности киномеханика, билетёра, менеджера и дворника. Вскоре он стал одержим киноиндустрией и решил, что может намного лучше сыграть в кино, чем это ­­­делают увиденные им актёры. По совету друга в 1913 году он переехал в город Джэксонвилл в штат Флорида, где стал в ночное время петь в водевилях в кабаре и ночных клубах, а днём проводил время на местной киностудии «Lubin Studios».

Наиболее часто он играл толстяков или злодеев в комедийных фильмах, где его крупные габариты лишь дополняли его образы. После не менее плодотворного 1915 года Харди переехал в Нью-Йорк, где стал сниматься на киностудиях «Pathé», «Casino» и «Edison Studios».\\nПо возвращении в Джэксонвилл Харди уже не вернулся на «Lubin», а стал сотрудничать со студиями «Vim» и «King Bee studios». Там он часто снимался вместе с Чарли Чаплином, при этом во многом подражая комику Эрику Кэмпбеллу, с которым Чаплин сотрудничал годом ранее. После переезда в Лос-Анджелес в 1917 году Оливер Харди стал работать сразу на нескольких независимых голливудских студиях. В том же году он снялся в комедии Брончо Билли Андерсона «Пёс-талисман», где его коллегой по экрану впервые стал Стэн Лорел. Всё же их знаменитый дуэт образовался позже, а после 1917 они не снимались вместе несколько лет.\\nС 1918 по 1923 год Харди работал на киностудии «Vitagraph», где также играл комедийные роли толстяков в компании с актёром Ларри Симонном. В 1919 году он разошёлся со своей женой, а в 1920 году был оформлен официальный развод, якобы из-за неверности Харди.

Режиссёр студии «Hal Roach Studios» Лео МакКэри заметил большой интерес аудитории к совместным работам Харди и Лорела и в дальнейшем стал умышленно снимать их вместе, что в итоге к концу того же года привело к появлению дуэта под названием Лорел и Харди, ставшего, возможно, одним из самых известных комических дуэтов в истории кино.\\nВслед за этим последовало множество новых совместных комедий, среди которых «Рано в кровать» (1928), «Доходное дело» (1929), «Идеальный день» (1929), «Ещё одна хорошая путаница» (1930), «Будь больше!» (1931), «Украденные драгоценности» (1931) и множество других кинокомедий. Их первая комедия, снятая в цвете, вышла на экраны в 1930 году и называлась «Песня мошенника», а год спустя они впервые появились в полнометражном фильме «Простите нас», хотя вплоть до 1935 года продолжали появляться и в короткометражках.

His father Oliver was a Confederate veteran who had been wounded at the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862. After his demobilization as a recruiting officer for Company K, 16th Georgia Regiment, the elder Oliver Hardy assisted his father in running the vestiges of the family cotton plantation. He bought a share in a retail business and was elected full-time Tax Collector for Columbia County, Georgia. Norvell’s mother Emily Norvell was the daughter of Thomas Benjamin Norvell and Mary Freeman, descended from Captain Hugh Norvell of Williamsburg, Virginia, who had arrived in Virginia before 1635. Hardy and Norvell had married March 12, 1890; it was the second marriage for the widow Emily, and the third for Oliver. He was of paternal English American descent and maternal Scottish American descent.\\nThe family moved to Madison in 1891, before Norvell’s birth. Emily Hardy owned a house in Harlem, which was either empty or rented out to tenant farmers. Norvell was likely born in Harlem, though some sources say that his birth occurred in Covington, his mother’s home town. His father died less than a year after his birth. Hardy was the youngest of five children. His older brother Sam Hardy died in a drowning accident in the Oconee River. Hardy pulled his brother from the river but was unable to resuscitate him.\\nAs a child, Hardy was sometimes difficult. He was sent to Georgia Military College in Milledgeville as a youngster. He was sent to Young Harris College in north Georgia in the 1905-1906 school year fall semester (September–January) when he was 13. He was in the junior high component of that institution of the time (the equivalent of high school today).\\nHardy had little interest in formal education, although he acquired an early interest in music and theater, possibly from his mother’s tenants. He joined a theatrical group, and later ran away from a boarding school near Atlanta to sing with the group. His mother recognized his talent for singing and sent him to Atlanta to study music and voice with singing teacher Adolf Dahm-Petersen. Hardy skipped some of his lessons to sing in the Alcazar Theater, a cinema, for US$3.50 a week. He subsequently decided to go back to Milledgeville.\\nSometime prior to 1910, Hardy began styling himself «Oliver Norvell Hardy», adding the first name «Oliver» as a tribute to his father. He appeared as «Oliver N. Hardy» in the 1910 U.S. census,[N 1] and he used «Oliver» as his first name in all subsequent legal records, marriage announcements, etc.\\n\\nHardy was initiated into Freemasonry at Solomon Lodge No. 20 in Jacksonville, Florida. His membership is mentioned in the TV interview on an episode of This Is Your Life in 1954.

He soon became obsessed with the new motion picture industry, and was convinced that he could do a better job than the actors he saw. A friend suggested that he move to Jacksonville, Florida, where some films were being made. In 1913, Hardy did that, working in Jacksonville as a cabaret and vaudeville singer at night, and at the Lubin Manufacturing Company during the day. It was at this time that he met Madelyn Saloshin, a pianist, whom he married on November 17, 1913 in Macon, Georgia.\\nThe next year he made his first movie, Outwitting Dad (1914), for the Lubin studio. He was billed as O. N. Hardy. In his personal life, he was known as «Babe» Hardy, a nickname that he was given by an Italian barber, who would apply talcum powder to Oliver’s cheeks and say, «nice-a-bab-y.» In many of his later films at Lubin, he was billed as «Babe Hardy.» Hardy was a big man at 6’1» tall and weighing up to 300 pounds. His size placed limitations on the roles he could play. He was most often cast as «the heavy» or the villain. He also frequently had roles in comedy shorts, his size complementing the character.\\nBy 1915, Hardy had made 50 short one-reeler films at Lubin. He later moved to New York and made films for the Pathé, Casino and Edison Studios. After returning to Jacksonville, he made films for the Vim Comedy Company. That studio closed after Hardy discovered the owners were stealing from the payroll.[4] He worked for the King Bee studio, which bought Vim. He worked with Bill Ruge, Billy West (a Charlie Chaplin imitator), and comedic actress Ethel Burton Palmer during this time. (Hardy continued playing the «heavy» for West well into the early 1920s, often imitating Eric Campbell to West’s Chaplin.)\\nWith Stan Laurel in The Lucky Dog (1921), long before they became a team.\\nIn 1917 Hardy moved to Los Angeles, working freelance for several Hollywood studios. Between 1918 and 1923, Hardy made more than 40 films for Vitagraph, mostly playing the «heavy» for Larry Semon. In 1919, he separated from his wife, ending with a provisional divorce in November 1920, which was finalized on November 17, 1921. On November 24, 1921, Hardy married again, to actress Myrtle Reeves. This marriage was also unhappy. Reeves was said to have become alcoholic.\\nIn 1921, he appeared in the movie The Lucky Dog, produced by G.M. («Broncho Billy») Anderson and starring a young British comedian named Stan Laurel.[5] Oliver Hardy played the part of a robber, trying to stick up Stan’s character. They did not work together again for several years. In 1924, Hardy began working at Hal Roach Studios with the Our Gang films and Charley Chase. In 1925, he starred as the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz. Also that year he was in the film, Yes, Yes, Nanette!, starring Jimmy Finlayson and directed by Stan Laurel. (In later years Finlayson frequently was a supporting actor in the Laurel and Hardy film series.) He also continued playing supporting roles in films featuring Clyde Cooke and Bobby Ray.\\n\\nIn 1926, Hardy was scheduled to appear in Get ‘Em Young. He was unexpectedly hospitalized after being burned by a hot leg of lamb. Laurel, who had been working as a gag man and director at Roach Studios, was recruited to fill in.  Laurel continued to act and, later that year, appeared in the same movie as Hardy, 45 Minutes from Hollywood, although they did not share any scenes together.\\nMovie poster of Another Fine Mess (1930)\\nIn 1927, Laurel and Hardy began sharing screen time together in Slipping Wives, Duck Soup (no relation to the 1933 Marx Brothers’ film of the same name) and With Love and Hisses. Roach Studios’ supervising director Leo McCarey, realizing the audience reaction to the two, began intentionally teaming them together. This led to the start of a Laurel and Hardy series later that year.\\nThey began producing a huge body of short movies, including The Battle of the Century (1927) (with one of the largest pie fights ever filmed), Should Married Men Go Home? (1928), Two Tars (1928), Unaccustomed As We Are (1929, marking their transition to talking pictures) Berth Marks (1929), Blotto (1930), Brats (1930) (with Stan and Ollie portraying themselves, as well as their own «sons», using oversized furniture sets for the «young» Laurel and Hardy); Another Fine Mess (1930), Be Big! (1931), and many others.\\nIn 1929, they appeared in their first feature, in one of the revue sequences of Hollywood Revue of 1929, and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in a lavish all-color (in Technicolor) musical feature entitled The Rogue Song. This film marked their first appearance in color, yet only a few fragments of this film survive. In 1931, they starred in their first full-length movie, Pardon Us; they continued to make features and shorts until 1935. The Music Box, a 1932 short, won them an Academy Award for best short film — their only such award.\\nLaurel and Hardy in The Flying Deuces (1939)\\nIn 1936, Hardy and Myrtle Reeves divorced. In 1939, while waiting for a contractual issue between Laurel and Hal Roach to be resolved, Hardy made Zenobia with Harry Langdon. Eventually, however, new contracts were agreed upon and the team was loaned out to producer Boris Morros at General Service Studios to make The Flying Deuces (1939). While on the lot, Hardy fell in love with Virginia Lucille Jones, a script girl, whom he married the next year. They enjoyed a happy marriage until his death.\\nIn 1939, Laurel and Hardy made A Chump at Oxford (1940) (which features a moment of role reversal, with Oliver becoming a subordinate to a temporarily concussed Stan) and Saps at Sea (1940) before leaving Roach Studios. They began performing for the USO, supporting the Allied troops during World War II. They teamed up to make films for 20th Century Fox and later Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Although they made more money at the bigger studios, they had very little artistic control; critics say that these films lack the very qualities that had made Laurel and Hardy worldwide names. Their last Fox feature was The Bullfighters (1945), after which they declined to extend their contract with the studio.\\nIn 1947, Laurel and Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom. Initially unsure of how they would be received, they were mobbed wherever they went. The tour was lengthened to include engagements in Scandinavia, Belgium, France, as well as a Royal Command Performance for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Biographer John McCabe said they continued to make live appearances in the United Kingdom and France for the next several years, until 1954, often using new sketches and material that Laurel had written for them.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Oliver Hardy in The Fighting Kentuckian (1949)\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nIn 1949, Hardy’s friend, John Wayne, asked him to play a supporting role in The Fighting Kentuckian. Hardy had previously worked with Wayne and John Ford in a charity production of the play What Price Glory? while Laurel began treatment for his diabetes a few years previously. Initially hesitant, Hardy accepted the role at the insistence of his comedy partner. Frank Capra later invited Hardy to play a cameo role in Riding High with Bing Crosby in 1950.\\nDuring 1950–51, Laurel and Hardy made their final film. Atoll K (also known as Utopia) was a simple concept; Laurel inherits an island, and the boys set out to sea, where they encounter a storm and discover a brand new island, rich in uranium, making them powerful and wealthy. However, the film was produced by a consortium of European interests, with an international cast and crew that could not speak to each other.[8] In addition, the script needed to be rewritten by Laurel to make it fit the comedy team’s style, and both suffered serious physical illness during the filming.\\nOliver Hardy, along with Stan Laurel, made two live television appearances: In 1953, on a live BBC television broadcast of the popular show «Face the Music» with host Henry Hall and in December 1954, on NBC’s This Is Your Life. They also appeared in a filmed insert for the BBC-TV show This Is Music Hall in 1955, their final public appearance together.\\nParty due to the overwhelmingly positive response to the This Is Your Life telecast, the pair contracted with Hal Roach, Jr., to produce a series of TV shows based on the Mother Goose fables in 1955. According to biographer John McCabe, they were to be filmed in color for NBC, but the series was postponed when Laurel suffered a stroke and required a lengthy convalescence.

During 1956, he began looking after his health for the first time in his life. He lost more than 150 pounds in a few months, which completely changed his appearance. Letters written by Laurel refer to Hardy having terminal cancer. Some readers have thought this was the real reason for Hardy’s rapid weight loss. Both men were heavy smokers. Hal Roach said they were a couple of «freight train smoke stacks».\\nHardy suffered a major stroke on September 14, 1956, which left him confined to bed and unable to speak for several months. He remained at home, in the care of his beloved Lucille. He suffered two more strokes in early August 1957, and slipped into a coma from which he never recovered. Hardy died from cerebral thrombosis on August 7, 1957, at the age of 65. [N 2] His cremated remains are located in the Masonic Garden of Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood.

Мать, Шарлотта Хеннесси, происходила из семьи ирландских католиков и зарабатывала на жизнь шитьём. У Глэдис были младшие брат и сестра — Джек и Лотти, — которые впоследствии взяли фамилию из её псевдонима и тоже стали актёрами.

На представлении присутствовали канадские солдаты, призванные в Южную Африку воевать с бурами .\\nСемья Смитов на протяжении шести лет играла в водевилях и дешёвых мелодрамах. Осенью 1901 года они отправились в Буффало и пять лет гастролировали по Америке, работая на различные театральные компании. В 1907 году пятнадцатилетняя Глэдис добилась аудиенции у продюсера Дэвида Беласко и получила второстепенную роль в пьесе «Уоррены из Вирджинии»  с гонораром в 25 долларов в неделю. По настоянию Беласко она изменила своё достаточно тривиальное имя на псевдоним — Мэри Пикфорд  — и 3 декабря дебютировала на Бродвее. Автором пьесы был Вильям ДеМилль, брат которого Сесил Б.

Она считала кинематограф менее значимым искусством, нежели театр, но тем не менее в начале 1909 года обратилась на киностудию Biograph Studios. Режиссёр Д. У. Гриффит устроил девушке пробы и, так как их результаты удовлетворили его, в тот же день снял её в короткометражке. Мэри, которая с самого начала карьеры проявляла деловую хватку, настояла на гонораре в 10 долларов в день, и Гриффит согласился (при том, что обычно платил актёрам вдвое меньшую сумму). В 1909 году он снял актрису более чем в 50 фильмах. Это было обусловлено тем фактом, что производство на заре кинематографа отнимало немного времени — фильмы, занимавшие одну бобину киноплёнки, длились не более 12 минут и зачастую снимались практически без сценария.\\nСемнадцатилетняя Пикфорд в одном из своих первых фильмов — драме «Одинокая вилла» (1909) с хронометражем всего в 8 минут\\nВ январе 1910 года Гриффит перевёз свою труппу из Нью-Йорка в Лос-Анджелес. Тогда многие кинокомпании проводили зиму на юге западного побережья, так как на северо-восточном светлое время суток становилось короче, и это затрудняло съёмочный процесс. Хотя основной причиной переезда была возможность не платить за грабительские патенты производителей съёмочной техники. Мэри продолжала активно работать, и, хотя в то время на Biograph Studios ещё не существовало титров с перечислением актёров, публика запомнила её, прозвав девочкой с золотыми кудряшками.\\nВ декабре 1910 года Мэри покинула Гриффита и перешла на киностудию Томаса Х. Инса IMP Company, подписав контракт с гонораром в 175 долларов в неделю. Однако качество фильмов (всего более тридцати), снятых на IMP, разочаровало её, и актриса обратилась в суд с требованием разорвать контракт. Выиграв дело, она стала работать на Majestic Film Corp. с ещё большим гонораром в 225 долларов в неделю. Несмотря на то, что кинокомпания приняла в штат в качестве режиссёра её супруга, — актёра Оуэна Мура, за которого Пикфорд вышла в начале года, — их сотрудничество не задалось, и в 1912 году актриса вернулась к Гриффиту. К тому времени она стала широко известна. Пресса все чаще упоминала имя маленькой Мэри  и анонсировала ленты с её участием. Пикфорд завоевала любовь публики благодаря тому, что её игра отличалась интимностью исполнения: актриса выражала эмоции взглядом, а не экспрессивными жестами , и, как писали газеты, вкладывала в игру всё сердце и душу.\\nВ январе 1913 года Пикфорд вернулась на сцену, сыграв в спектакле Беласко под названием «Хорошенький дьяволёнок» (небольшая роль в нём была отведена Лиллиан Гиш, восходящей звезде немого кино). Беласко согласился платить актрисе 250 долларов в неделю, что в 10 раз превышало её гонорар шестилетней давности. Затем продюсер Адольф Цукор предложил Пикфорд экранизировать пьесу. Она согласилась и подписала контракт с его кинокомпанией Famous Players, на этот раз покинув Гриффита окончательно. В 1914 году вышло семь полнометражных фильмов с участием Пикфорд (у Гриффита она снималась только в короткометражках), и в том числе мелодрама «Тэсс из Страны бурь». Роль дочери сквоттера стала поворотным моментом её карьеры. С тех пор кинопоказы фильмов Пикфорд стали сопровождаться такими аншлагами, что газеты советовали зрителям занимать места пораньше, дабы избежать давки .\\nСотрудничество Пикфорд и Цукора сложилось невероятно успешно. Появившись за четыре года в двух десятках полнометражных фильмов, актриса превратилась в объект фанатичного обожания публики и настоящую кинозвезду — божественную куколку, воспеваемую поклонниками в стихах . Вслед за популярностью росли и гонорары: к 1916 году Мэри получала 2 тысячи долларов в неделю и половину прибыли от проката.\\nВ тот же период окончательно сложилось её актёрское амплуа, в котором она задержалась на долгие годы. Миловидная внешность Пикфорд — миниатюрное сложение и нежное лицо, обрамлённое завитыми локонами — идеально подходила к типажам её героинь. Преимущественно ими были обездоленные сироты, девочки-подростки бедного происхождения, несправедливо обиженные жизнью девушки. Эти персонажи находили отклик в сердцах публики, вызывая сочувствие и расположение.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"На вершине славы\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nЗа пределами съёмочной площадки Пикфорд была не настолько беспомощна, как её героини, и отличалась незаурядными деловыми качествами. В 1916 году она основала собственную кинокомпанию Mary Pickford Company, которая несколько лет функционировала под патронажем Famous Players, и получила почти исключительные права на свои фильмы. Она могла отбирать для себя роли, выбирать по своему усмотрению режиссёров и актёров второго плана, утверждать рекламные кампании своих фильмов и высказывать мнение относительно монтажа. Эта договорённость позволила Пикфорд собрать съёмочную группу, с которой ей было комфортно работать. В частности она наняла режиссёра Маршалла Нилана и оператора Чарльза Рошера, которые были заняты соответственно на восьми и восемнадцати картинах актрисы. Сумма её гонорара поднялась до 10 тысяч долларов в неделю , плюс Пикфорд сохраняла право на половину прибыли от проката.\\nИз года в год популярность актрисы продолжала расти. Её наиболее кассовыми картинами 1917 и 1918 годов были «Гордость клана» (на одном из сеансов произошло такое столпотворение, что зрители вышибли дверь в кинотеатр) , «Маленькая принцесса», «Звезда морей», «Ребекка с фермы Саннибрук» и «Бедная маленькая богатая девочка». Автором сценариев последних двух лент была Фрэнсис Марион — открытая Пикфорд, она впоследствии написала около полутора десятков сценариев к картинам актрисы и в 1921 году срежиссировала драму с её участием под названием «Свет любви». Героинями Мэри по-прежнему становились девочки-подростки, однако в некоторых картинах — например, в анти-военном фильме «Маленькая американка» и комедии «Вербовка Джоанны» — она играла вполне взрослых девушек.\\nВ 1918 году актриса подписала контракт с First National, обязавшись сняться в трёх картинах с фиксированным гонораром в 675 тысяч долларов — около 10 миллионов долларов в пересчёте по современному курсу. Этими фильмами, производство которых от стадии сценария до финального монтажа она по-прежнему была вправе контролировать, стали «Длинноногий папочка», «Хулиганка» и «Сердце холмов» (вышли в прокат в 1919 году).\\nВ начале 1919 года Пикфорд, Дуглас Фэрбенкс, Чарли Чаплин и Д. У. Гриффит, объединившись, создали собственную кинокомпанию United Artists, которая занималась исключительно прокатом фильмов. Решение основать собственную компанию-дистрибутор было обусловлено стремлением сломать бытовавшую в то время в Голливуде вертикальную схему работы — крупные студии не только контролировали производство фильмов, но и распространение, отдавая их в прокат в сети собственных кинотеатров.\\nБудучи соучредителем United Artists и продюсером своих фильмов, Пикфорд превратилась в одну из самых влиятельных женщин, когда-либо работавших в киноиндустрии. Первоначально по условиям контракта актриса, равно как и остальные сооснователи, обязалась выпускать по пять фильмов в год. Однако вскоре от этой договоренности пришлось отказаться: производство становилось все более дорогостоящим и длительным процессом. В 1920 году вышло всего две ленты с участием Пикфорд, в 1921 году — три, а затем она окончательно снизила темп и стала выпускать по одному фильму в год.\\nПервым фильмом Мэри по контракту с United Artists стала трагикомедия «Поллианна», снятая по роману Элеоноры Портер. Эта история о кроткой и добродетельной девочке-сироте пользовалась шумным успехом у публики и собрала в мировом прокате более миллиона долларов . Примечательно, что исключительная добросердечность Поллианны угнетала Пикфорд, которая к тому времени уже начинала уставать от светлых, но достаточно однообразных характеров своих героинь . Общество, впрочем, тогда только приветствовало назидательные сюжеты в кинематографе, а реклама «Поллианны» открыто сообщала, что героиня Пикфорд научит любого, как озарить светом свою жизнь и жизни других .\\nДалее, после трагикомедии «Мыльная пена», где Мэри сыграла мечтательную прачку-замарашку, последовали драма «Свет любви», комедия «С чёрного хода» и экранизация повести Фрэнсис Барнетт «Маленький лорд Фаунтлерой». Последнему фильму (его вторым режиссёром был брат актрисы Джек Пикфорд) сопутствовали большие сборы в прокате , более того — картина добралась и до послереволюционной России, где была выпущена под названием «Два претендента». В «Маленьком лорде Фаунтлерое» Пикфорд исполнила сразу две роли — юного наследника Седрика Эррола и его матери.\\nВ 1922 году актриса снялась в ремейке собственного хита восьмилетней давности, мелодраме «Тэсс из Страны бурь». Далее она решила рискнуть и реализовать своё давнее желание вырваться из детского амплуа — Пикфорд достигла тридцатилетнего возраста и устала играть викторианских девочек-подростков, кроме того, этот образ постепенно начал выходить из моды . В 1923 году она пригласила к сотрудничеству немецкого режиссёра Эрнста Любича и снялась в его первом американском фильме, мелодраме «Розита». Её героиня, уличная певица Розита, испытавшая на себе бремя любви короля Испании, представляла собой по-настоящему взрослую женщину, но, к сожалению — несмотря на роскошные декорации и прекрасную прессу, которая провозгласила картину очередным триумфом актрисы , — фильм пользовался меньшим успехом, нежели её предыдущие работы.\\nПоняв, что публика отказывается воспринимать её во взрослом облике, Пикфорд вернулась к былому амплуа. В выпущенном в 1924 году историческом фильме «Дороти Вернон из Хэддон-Холла» она сыграла молодую девушку, в трагикомедии «Маленькая Анни Руни» (1925) — двенадцатилетнюю девочку-сорванца, в драме «Воробушки» (1926) — сироту-подростка. Но тем не менее в следующем 1927 году актрисе исполнилось 35 лет, и она сыграла взрослую роль в мелодраме «Моя любимая девушка».\\nВ марте 1928 года от рака груди умерла мать Пикфорд, и актриса тяжело переживала её смерть. В том же году она решила окончательно порвать с детским имиджем и остригла свои прославленные золотые локоны. При этом событии присутствовали журналисты, и фотографии Пикфорд из парикмахерского салона попали на первые полосы газет.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Закат карьеры\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nВ 1929 году в свои права начинала вступать эпоха звукового кино, и Пикфорд, разумеется, не могла игнорировать этот факт. Она приобрела права на экранизацию пьесы 1927 года под названием «Кокетка» — это была трагическая история о красавице Норме Безант и её возлюбленном, которого застрелил её отец. Оператором фильма должен был стать давний друг актрисы Чарльз Рошер, однако Пикфорд уволила его, когда тот прервал на середине её сцену. Рошер решил вмешаться в процесс по причине того, что на лицо актрисы легла тень, но тем не менее Пикфорд назначила оператором другого человека . Публика в конечном итоге с восторгом приняла «Кокетку» , а Пикфорд получила за роль Нормы своего первого и единственного «Оскара». Критики, однако, отнеслись к фильму более прохладно .\\nВ 1929 году Пикфорд выпустила ещё один фильм — комедию «Укрощение строптивой» по одноимённому произведению Шекспира, где появилась в паре со своим вторым мужем Дугласом Фэрбенксом. Затем в 1930 году начала производство картины «Твоя навечно», однако из-за пристрастия к алкоголю режиссёра Маршалла Нилана заморозила проект и уничтожила отснятые материалы. Следующая картина Пикфорд, мюзикл «Кики» по мотивам пьесы Беласко, вышла в 1931 году и провалилась в прокате, возместив только половину затраченного бюджета.\\nЕё следующая картина — вестерн 1933 года «Секреты» — тоже не имела кассового успеха.

В 1918 году, когда шла Первая мировая война, актриса совместно с Дугласом Фэрбенксом, Чарли Чаплином и Мэри Дресслер  посетила с публичными выступлениями несколько городов, призывая граждан покупать облигации военного займа — доход от них шёл на финансирование военных нужд.\\nКогда Пикфорд выступала на Wall Street, её аудитория составила около 50 тысяч человек — несмотря на своё канадское происхождение, она превратилась в один из главных символов Америки тех лет, и благодаря её усилиям в поддержку армии была собрана значительная сумма. Кроме того, совместно с Монти Блю и Джоан Марш она выпустила агитационную короткометражку «Стопроцентные американцы». В то время Пикфорд была очень популярна в армии: в её честь были названы две пушки, 143-й артиллерийский полк носил неофициальное название «Барашки Мэри» , а сама она в феврале 1918 года была возведена в ранг почётного полковника и присутствовала на военных парадах .\\nВ 1921 году Пикфорд совместно с Фэрбенксом, Чаплином и Гриффитом организовала Фонд помощи нуждающимся киноактёрам (функционирует до сих пор) и стала его вице-президентом. Чтобы собрать средства, устроителями проводились благотворительные балы и киносеансы, спортивные мероприятия, показы мод и др. В 1932 году по инициативе Пикфорд фонд обратился к деятелям киноиндустрии, заработок которых превышал 200 долларов в неделю, с просьбой перечислять полпроцента или один процент от своего гонорара в пользу их менее удачливых коллег. \\nВ 1927 году Пикфорд была в составе влиятельных голливудских лиц, основавших Американскую академию киноискусства. Её соучредителями являлись актёры Дуглас Фэрбенкс и Гарольд Ллойд, режиссёры Фред Нибло и Рауль Уолш, продюсеры Джек Уорнер и Ирвинг Тальберг, а также другие деятели, составлявшие цвет американского кинематографа тех лет.\\nЗатем в 1941 году, уже перестав сниматься в кино, Пикфорд предприняла вторую попытку ослабить влияние крупных студий (в то время монополия на производство и прокат фильмов почти целиком принадлежала MGM, Paramount Pictures, RKO, Warner Bros. и 20th Century Fox) и совместно с Уолтом Диснеем, Орсоном Уэллсом, Чарли Чаплином и другими основала Объединение независимых кинопродюсеров (функционировало до 1958 года).\\nВ 1944 году Мэри стала председателем женского отделения основанного Рузвельтом Национального фонда борьбы с полиомиелитом и посещала госпитали, где лежали больные дети.

Её мать, которая на протяжении многих лет имела большое влияние на Мэри, не разделяла симпатию дочери к Муру, поэтому некоторое время супруги скрывали от неё свои отношения. Их брак оказался неудачным из-за алкоголизма Мура и его неприятия популярности супруги. Начиная с 1914 года они жили раздельно, а затем Пикфорд завязала роман с Дугласом Фэрбенксом — в то время он выступал на Бродвее и вскоре стал столь же знаменит в кино, как и Мэри.\\nНекоторое время они хранили свою связь в секрете от окружающих. Так как Фэрбенкс был женат, Пикфорд опасалась, что огласка приведет к скандалу, и не хотела портить свою безупречную репутацию. Однако они появлялись вместе на публике во время благотворительных туров 1918 года. 2 марта 1920 года Пикфорд наконец развелась с Муром, и в прессе начали циркулировать слухи о её возможном браке с Фэрбенксом. Несмотря на то, что актриса заявила о беспочвенности подобных слухов , 28 марта она всё-таки вышла за Фэрбенкса (актёр стал свободен ещё в ноябре 1919 года).\\nЦеремония прошла в закрытом кругу — не были приглашены даже их близкие друзья, включая Чаплина, — а свидетелями выступили сводный брат жениха Джон Фэрбенкс и актриса Марджори Доу . 19 мая 1920 года молодожёны отплыли на пароходе Royal George в Европу и провели там всё лето . Осенью 1920 года, вскоре после того, как они вернулись в Америку, имя Пикфорд оказалось косвенно вовлечено в скандал, когда 10 сентября жена её брата Джека, актриса Олив Томас, скончалась во Франции, случайно выпив раствор сулемы (этим лекарством её супруг пытался вылечиться от хронического сифилиса).\\nПосле медового месяца звёздная чета поселились вместе в огромном поместье Фэрбенкса неподалеку от Лос-Анджелеса, которое получило название от слияния их имен — Пикфэр. На протяжении 20-х годов Пикфорд и Фэрбенкс составляли самую известную супружескую пару Голливуда. На проводимых в их поместье приёмах собирался цвет артистического, политического и интеллектуального сообществ тех лет. В 1927 году они стали первыми актёрами, которые оставили отпечатки своих ладоней на цементной плите перед входом в кинотеатр Grauman’s Chinese Theate. Слава сопутствовала актёрам по всему миру — и в том числе в СССР.\\nЛетом 1926 года Пикфорд и Фэрбенкс побывали в Советском Союзе, где затем была выпущена книга «Они у нас. Мери Пикфорд и Дуглас Фербенкс в СССР» . Также в 1927 году вышел фильм Сергея Комарова «Поцелуй Мэри Пикфорд». Его производство было само по себе курьёзом: документальные кадры из хроники пребывания актёров на Украине (в частности эпизод, где Мэри поцеловала одного из поклонников) были смонтированы с отснятым уже после их отъезда материалом. В итоге получилась комедия о простом парне Гоге, которому не везёт в любви, но после поцелуя звезды дамы начинают обращать на него внимание. Пикфорд узнала о существовании этого фильма только в конце жизни.\\nОднако и этот брак актрисы в итоге распался. Из-за плотного съёмочного графика супруги проводили друг с другом немного времени. Помимо этого Фэрбенкс любил путешествовать и начиная с 1930 года уезжал в одиночку, оставляя жену дома. В начале 30-х он увлёкся британской актрисой леди Сильвией Эшли, и этот роман подвёл черту под его браком с Пикфорд. Они стали жить раздельно и развелись 10 января 1936 года. В марте 1936 года Фэрбенкс женился на Эшли. Пикфорд тоже недолго оставалась одна. 24 июня 1937 года она вышла замуж за актёра и джазового музыканта Чарльза «Бадди» Роджерса (своего партнёра в фильме 1927 года «Моя любимая девушка»), но тем не менее сохранила привязанность к Фэрбенксу и, когда в 1939 году он скончался от сердечного приступа, глубоко переживала утрату . В 1943 и 1944 годах Пикфорд и Роджерс усыновили соответственно мальчика Рональда Чарльза и девочку Роксанну. Они прожили вместе более сорока лет до самой смерти актрисы в 1979 году.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Последние годы жизни и смерть\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nЗа Пикфорд долгое время сохранялся статус влиятельного лица в Голливуде — даже после того, как она перестала сниматься. На протяжении 1940-х годов она занималась продюсированием фильмов, выпустив, среди прочих, драму «Спи, моя любовь» (1948) с Клодет Кольбер и комедию «Счастливая любовь» (1949) с братьями Маркс. Её частная жизнь, между тем, была далека от благополучия. За несколько лет она потеряла одного за другим всех своих близких родственников. В 1928 году умерла её мать, в 1933 — брат Джек, в 1936 — сестра Лотти. Болезненное расставание с Фэрбенксом тоже способствовало развитию депрессии, и актриса пристрастилась к алкоголю.\\nЕё приемные дети, повзрослев, рано ушли из дома. Со временем Пикфорд стала вести очень уединённую жизнь и редко покидала Пикфэр, позволяя навещать себя только Лиллиан Гиш, своему пасынку Дугласу Фэрбенксу-младшему и некоторым близким друзьям. В середине 1960-х годов она общалась с внешним миром по телефону, не выходя из спальни. В 1976 году Пикфорд наградили почётным «Оскаром» за вклад в развитие кинематографа, и съёмочная группа, направленная в Пикфэр, запечатлела короткое благодарственное выступление актрисы.\\nНезадолго до смерти Пикфорд обратилась к правительству Канады с просьбой восстановить её гражданство, которое, как она считала, было утеряно после брака с Фэрбенксом, американским гражданином. Канада удовлетворила просьбу знаменитой соотечественницы, и таким образом на закате жизни у неё появилось двойное гражданство. Мэри Пикфорд — любимица Америки, когда-то обожаемая миллионами — скончалась от кровоизлияния в мозг 29 мая 1979 года в возрасте восьмидесяти семи лет. Она была похоронена на кладбище мемориального парка Форест-Лаун в Калифорнии на том же участке, где покоились её мать, брат и сестра.\")])]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"paper__half\"\n  }, [_c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Gladys Louise Smith\")]), _vm._v(\" (April 8, 1892 – May 29, 1979), known professionally as Mary Pickford, was a Canadian-American film actress, writer, director, and producer. She was a co-founder of the film studio United Artists and one of the original 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. \\nKnown in her prime as “America’s Sweetheart”   and the “girl with the curls”,  Pickford was one of the Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood and a significant figure in the development of film acting. Pickford was one of the earliest stars to be billed under her name (film performers up until that time were usually unbilled), and was one of the most popular actresses of the 1910s and ‘20s, earning the nickname “Queen of the Movies”.\\nShe was awarded the second ever Academy Award for Best Actress for her first sound film role in Coquette (1929) and also received an honorary Academy Award in 1976. In consideration of her contributions to American cinema, the American Film Institute ranked Pickford as 24th in its 1999 list of greatest female stars of classic Hollywood Cinema.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Early life\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nMary Pickford was born Gladys Louise Smith in 1892 (although she would later claim 1893 or 1894 as her year of birth) at 211 University Avenue,A Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Her father, John Charles Smith, was the son of English Methodist immigrants, and worked a variety of odd jobs. Her mother, Charlotte Hennessey, was of Irish Catholic descent and worked for a time as a seamstress. She had two younger siblings, Charlotte, called “Lottie” (born 1893), and John Charles, called “Jack” (born 1896), who also became actors. To please her husband’s relatives, Pickford’s mother baptized her children as Methodists, the faith of their father. John Charles Smith was an alcoholic; he abandoned the family and died on February 11, 1898, from a fatal blood clot caused by a workplace accident when he was a purser with Niagara Steamship. \\nWhen Gladys was age four, her household was under infectious quarantine, a public health measure. Their devoutly Catholic maternal grandmother (Catherine Faeley Hennessey) asked a visiting Roman Catholic priest to baptize the children. Pickford was at this time baptized as Gladys Marie Smith. \\nCharlotte Smith began taking in boarders after being widowed. One of these was a theatrical stage manager. At his suggestion, Gladys (age 7) was given two small roles, one as a boy and the other as a girl,  in a stock company production of The Silver King at Toronto’s Princess Theatre. She subsequently acted in many melodramas with Toronto’s Valentine Company, finally playing the major child role in their version of The Silver King. She capped her short career in Toronto with the starring role of Little Eva in their production of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, adapted from the 1852 novel by American writer and abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Career\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nBy the early 1900s, theatre had become a family enterprise. Gladys, her mother and two younger siblings toured the United States by rail, performing in third-rate companies and plays. After six impoverished years, Pickford allowed one more summer to land a leading role on Broadway, planning to quit acting if she failed. In 1906 Gladys, Lottie and Jack Smith supported singer Chauncey Olcott on Broadway in Edmund Burke.  Gladys finally landed a supporting role in a 1907 Broadway play, The Warrens of Virginia. The play was written by William C. deMille, whose brother, Cecil, appeared in the cast. David Belasco, the producer of the play, insisted that Gladys Smith assume the stage name Mary Pickford.  After completing the Broadway run and touring the play, however, Pickford was again out of work.\\nOn April 19, 1909, the Biograph Company director D. W. Griffith screen-tested her at the company’s New York studio for a role in the nickelodeon film, Pippa Passes. The role went to someone else but Griffith was immediately taken with Pickford. She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day. Most Biograph actors earned $5 a day but, after Pickford’s single day in the studio, Griffith agreed to pay her $10 a day against a guarantee of $40 a week. \\nPickford, like all actors at Biograph, played both bit parts and leading roles, including mothers, ingenues, charwomen, spitfires, slaves, Native Americans, spurned women, and a prostitute. As Pickford said of her success at Biograph: “I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I’d become known, and there would be a demand for my work.”\\nShe appeared in 51 films in 1909 – almost one a week. She also introduced her friend Florence La Badie to D. W. Griffith, who launched La Badie’s career. \\nIn January 1910, Pickford traveled with a Biograph crew to Los Angeles. Many other film companies wintered on the West Coast, escaping the weak light and short days that hampered winter shooting in the East. Pickford added to her 1909 Biographs (Sweet and Twenty, They Would Elope, and To Save Her Soul, to name a few) with films made in California.\\nActors were not listed in the credits in Griffith’s company. Audiences noticed and identified Pickford within weeks of her first film appearance. Exhibitors in turn capitalized on her popularity by advertising on sandwich boards that a film featuring “The Girl with the Golden Curls”, “Blondilocks”, or “The Biograph Girl” was inside. \\nPickford left Biograph in December 1910. The following year, she starred in films at Carl Laemmle’s Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP). IMP was absorbed into Universal Pictures in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford returned to work with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances were in his films, such as Friends, The Mender of Nets, Just Like a Woman, and The Female of the Species. That year Pickford also introduced Dorothy and Lillian Gish (both friends from her days in touring melodrama) to Griffith.  Both became major silent stars, in comedy and tragedy, respectively. Pickford made her last Biograph picture, The New York Hat, in late 1912.\\nShe returned to Broadway in the David Belasco production of A Good Little Devil (1912). This was a major turning point in her career. Pickford, who had always hoped to conquer the Broadway stage, discovered how deeply she missed film acting. In 1913, she decided to work exclusively in film. The previous year, Adolph Zukor had formed Famous Players in Famous Plays. It was later known as Famous Players-Lasky and then Paramount Pictures, one of the first American feature film companies.\\nPickford left the stage to join Zukor’s roster of stars. Zukor believed film’s potential lay in recording theatrical players in replicas of their most famous stage roles and productions. Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of A Good Little Devil. The film, produced in 1913, showed the play’s Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called “one of the worst [features] I ever made ... it was deadly”.  Zukor agreed; he held the film back from distribution for a year.\\nPickford’s work in material written for the camera by that time had attracted a strong following. Comedy-dramas, such as In the Bishop’s Carriage (1913), Caprice (1913), and especially Hearts Adrift (1914), made her irresistible to moviegoers. Hearts Adrift was so popular that Pickford asked for the first of her many publicized pay raises based on the profits and reviews.  The film marked the first time Pickford’s name was featured above the title on movie marquees.  Tess of the Storm Country was released five weeks later. Biographer Kevin Brownlow observed that the film “sent her career into orbit and made her the most popular actress in America, if not the world”. \\nHer appeal was summed up two years later by the February 1916 issue of Photoplay as “luminous tenderness in a steel band of gutter ferocity”.  Only Charlie Chaplin, who reportedly slightly surpassed Pickford’s popularity in 1916,  had a similarly spellbinding pull with critics and the audience. Each enjoyed a level of fame far exceeding that of other actors. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Pickford was believed to be the most famous woman in the world, or, as a silent-film journalist described her, “the best known woman who has ever lived, the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history.”\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Stardom\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nPickford starred in 52 features throughout her career. On June 24, 1916, Pickford signed a new contract with Zukor that granted her full authority over production of the films in which she starred,  and a record-breaking salary of $10,000 a week.  In addition, Pickford’s compensation was half of a film’s profits, with a guarantee of $1,040,000 (US$ 17,150,000 in 2016). Occasionally, she played a child, in films such as The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917), Daddy-Long-Legs (1919) and Pollyanna (1920). Pickford’s fans were devoted to these “Little Girl” roles, but they were not typical of her career. \\nIn August 1918, Pickford’s contract expired and, when refusing Zukor’s terms for a renewal, she was offered $250,000 to leave the motion picture business. She declined, and went to First National Pictures, which agreed to her terms.  In 1919, Pickford, along with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks, formed the independent film production company United Artists. Through United Artists, Pickford continued to produce and perform in her own movies; she could also distribute them as she chose. In 1920, Pickford’s film Pollyanna grossed around $1,100,000.  The following year, Pickford’s film Little Lord Fauntleroy was also a success, and in 1923, Rosita grossed over $1,000,000 as well.  During this period, she also made Little Annie Rooney (1925), another film in which Pickford played a child, Sparrows (1926), which blended the Dickensian with newly minted German expressionist style, and My Best Girl (1927), a romantic comedy featuring her future husband Buddy Rogers. \\nThe arrival of sound was her undoing. Pickford underestimated the value of adding sound to movies, claiming that “adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the Venus de Milo”. \\nShe played a reckless socialite in Coquette (1929), a role for which her famous ringlets were cut into a 1920s’ bob. Pickford had already cut her hair in the wake of her mother’s death in 1928. Fans were shocked at the transformation.  Pickford’s hair had become a symbol of female virtue, and when she cut it, the act made front-page news in The New York Times and other papers. Coquette was a success and won her an Academy Award for Best Actress,  although this was highly controversial.  The public failed to respond to her in the more sophisticated roles. Like most movie stars of the silent era, Pickford found her career fading as talkies became more popular among audiences. \\nHer next film, The Taming of The Shrew, made with husband Douglas Fairbanks, was not well received at the box office.  Established Hollywood actors were panicked by the impending arrival of the talkies. On March 29, 1928, The Dodge Brothers Hour was broadcast from Pickford’s bungalow, featuring Fairbanks, Chaplin, Norma Talmadge, Gloria Swanson, John Barrymore, D.W. Griffith, and Dolores del Rio, among others. They spoke on the radio show to prove that they could meet the challenge of talking movies. \\nBut the transition came as Pickford was in her late 30s, no longer able to play the children, teenage spitfires, and feisty young women so adored by her fans, and was not suited for the glamorous and vampish heroines of early sound. In 1933, Pickford underwent a Technicolor screen test for an animated/live action film version of Alice in Wonderland, but Walt Disney discarded the project when Paramount released its own version of the book. Only one Technicolor still of her screen test still exists. She retired from acting in 1933; her last acting film was released in 1934. She continued to produce for others, however, including Sleep, My Love (1948; with Claudette Colbert) and Love Happy (1949), with the Marx Brothers). \")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"The film industry\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nMary Pickford giving President Herbert Hoover a ticket for a film industry benefit for the unemployed, 1931\\nPickford used her stature in the movie industry to promote a variety of causes. Although her image depicted fragility and innocence, Pickford proved to be a worthy businesswoman who took control of her career in a cutthroat industry. \\nDuring World War I, she promoted the sale of Liberty Bonds, making an intensive series of fund-raising speeches that kicked off in Washington, D.C., where she sold bonds alongside Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Theda Bara, and Marie Dressler. Five days later she spoke on Wall Street to an estimated 50,000 people. Though Canadian-born, she was a powerful symbol of Americana, kissing the American flag for cameras and auctioning one of her world-famous curls for $15,000. In a single speech in Chicago she sold an estimated five million dollars’ worth of bonds. She was christened the U.S. Navy’s official “Little Sister”; the Army named two cannons after her and made her an honorary colonel. \\nAt the end of World War I, Pickford conceived of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, an organization to help financially needy actors. Leftover funds from her work selling Liberty Bonds were put toward its creation, and in 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was officially incorporated, with Joseph Schenck voted its first president and Pickford its vice president. In 1932, Pickford spearheaded the “Payroll Pledge Program”, a payroll-deduction plan for studio workers who gave one half of one percent of their earnings to the MPRF. As a result, in 1940, the Fund was able to purchase land and build the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital, in Woodland Hills, California. \\nAn astute businesswoman, Pickford became her own producer within three years of her start in features. According to her Foundation, “she oversaw every aspect of the making of her films, from hiring talent and crew to overseeing the script, the shooting, the editing, to the final release and promotion of each project.” She demanded (and received) these powers in 1916, when she was under contract to Zukor’s Famous Players In Famous Plays (later Paramount). Zukor acquiesced to her refusal to participate in block-booking, the widespread practice of forcing an exhibitor to show a bad film of the studio’s choosing to also be able to show a Pickford film. In 1916, Pickford’s films were distributed, singly, through a special distribution unit called Artcraft. The Mary Pickford Corporation was briefly Pickford’s motion-picture production company. \\nIn 1919, she increased her power by co-founding United Artists (UA) with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her soon-to-be husband, Douglas Fairbanks. Before UA’s creation, Hollywood studios were vertically integrated, not only producing films but forming chains of theaters. Distributors (also part of the studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company’s movie venues. Filmmakers relied on the studios for bookings; in return they put up with what many considered creative interference.\\nUnited Artists broke from this tradition. It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on Santa Monica Boulevard. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford’s acting career had largely faded.  After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, selling her remaining shares for three million dollars.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Personal life\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nPickford was married three times. She married Owen Moore, an Irish-born silent film actor, on January 7, 1911. It is rumored she became pregnant by Moore in the early 1910s and had a miscarriage or an abortion. Some accounts suggest this resulted in her later inability to have children.  The couple had numerous marital problems, notably Moore’s alcoholism, insecurity about living in the shadow of Pickford’s fame, and bouts of domestic violence. The couple lived together on-and-off for several years. \\nPickford became secretly involved in a relationship with Douglas Fairbanks. They toured the US together in 1918 to promote Liberty Bond sales for the World War I effort. Around this time, Pickford also suffered from the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic, but survived.  Pickford divorced Moore on March 2, 1920, after she agreed to his $100,000 demand for a settlement.  She married Fairbanks just days later on March 28, 1920. They went to Europe for their honeymoon; fans in London and in Paris caused riots trying to get to the famous couple. The couple’s triumphant return to Hollywood was witnessed by vast crowds who turned out to hail them at railway stations across the United States.\\nThe Mark of Zorro (1920) and a series of other swashbucklers gave the popular Fairbanks a more romantic, heroic image. Pickford continued to epitomize the virtuous but fiery girl next door. Even at private parties, people instinctively stood up when Pickford entered a room; she and her husband were often referred to as “Hollywood royalty”. Their international reputations were broad. Foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visited the White House often asked if they could also visit Pickfair, the couple’s mansion in Beverly Hills. \\nDinners at Pickfair included a number of notable guests. Charlie Chaplin, Fairbanks’ best friend, was often present. Other guests included George Bernard Shaw, Albert Einstein, Elinor Glyn, Helen Keller, H. G. Wells, Lord Mountbatten, Fritz Kreisler, Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Noël Coward, Max Reinhardt, Baron Nishi, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko,  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Austen Chamberlain, Sir Harry Lauder, and Meher Baba, among others. The public nature of Pickford’s second marriage strained it to the breaking point. Both she and Fairbanks had little time off from producing and acting in their films. They were also constantly on display as America’s unofficial ambassadors to the world, leading parades, cutting ribbons, and making speeches. When their film careers both began to flounder at the end of the silent era, Fairbanks’ restless nature prompted him to overseas travel (something which Pickford did not enjoy). When Fairbanks’ romance with Sylvia, Lady Ashley became public in the early 1930s, he and Pickford separated. They divorced January 10, 1936. Fairbanks’ son by his first wife, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., claimed his father and Pickford long regretted their inability to reconcile. \\nOn June 24, 1937, Pickford married her third and last husband, actor and band leader Buddy Rogers. They adopted two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). As a PBS American Experience documentary noted, Pickford’s relationship with her children was tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie’s small stature and Roxanne’s crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that “Things didn’t work out that much, you know. But I’ll never forget her. I think that she was a good woman.”\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Later years\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford became an alcoholic, as her father had been. Her mother Charlotte died of breast cancer in March 1928. Her siblings, Lottie and Jack, both died of alcohol-related causes. These deaths, her divorce from Fairbanks, and the end of silent films left Pickford deeply depressed. Her relationship with her children, Roxanne and Ronald, was turbulent at best. Pickford withdrew and gradually became a recluse, remaining almost entirely at Pickfair and allowing visits only from Lillian Gish, her stepson Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and few other people. She appeared in court in 1959, in a matter pertaining to her co-ownership of North Carolina TV station WSJS-TV. The court date coincided with the date of her 67th birthday; under oath, when asked to give her age, Pickford replied, “I’m 21, going on 20”. \\nIn the mid-1960s, Pickford often received visitors only by telephone, speaking to them from her bedroom. Buddy Rogers often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford in the drawing room. A print of this image now hangs in the Library of Congress.  In addition to her Oscar as best actress for Coquette (1929), Mary Pickford received an Academy Honorary Award in 1976 for lifetime achievement. The Academy sent a TV crew to her house to record her short statement of thanks – offering the public a very rare glimpse into Pickfair Manor. \\nPickford had become an American citizen upon her marriage to Fairbanks in 1920.  Toward the end of her life, Pickford made arrangements with the Department of Citizenship to regain her Canadian citizenship because she wished to “die as a Canadian”.

She rescued as many as she could accommodate and ultimately ended up with her own zoo containing over 200 animals of all sorts.  When Nell was 18 years old, she met and married 39 year old theatrical impresario, Ernest Shipman (December 17, 1871 – August 7, 1931).\\nAfter marrying, Ernest and Nell moved to Hollywood to start working in the film industry. During this time, Nell sold the rights of her book, Under the Crescent Moon to Universal Studios (they wanted to make a six film serial of the story). Nell also started acting in Universal, Selig & Vitagraph productions. Between 1915–1918, she played several leading roles including her big debut film God’s Country and the Woman (1915). Nell directed, produced, and acted in the film that was based on a James Oliver Curwood short story. She was one of the first directors to shoot her films almost entirely on location. \\nIn 1918, Nell Shipman suffered from Spanish influenza and nearly died. She also lost all of her beautiful thick long hair and was forced to wear a wig. Fortunately her distinctive locks grew back.  During her recovery, she decided to create a production company called “Shipman-Curwood Producing Company”. Through the efforts of Ernest Shipman, who convinced a consortium of Calgary businessmen to invest in the potential of Alberta becoming a major film location destination, a company, Canadian Photoplays Ltd., was incorporated on February 7, 1919, with a $250,000 investment. The first and only film the company would produce was based on another Curwood story, “Wapi the Walrus” and adapted to the screen by Nell herself. The name was changed to Back to God’s Country for no other reason than to capitalize on Nell’s success in God’s Country and the Woman. \\nThe 73-minute film (at 18 frames per second) was shot in Los Angeles, San Francisco and on location near Lesser Slave Lake, Alberta, Canada by director, David M. Hartford. The cameramen were Dal Clawson and Joseph B. Walker, who later gained fame as Hollywood director, Frank Capra’s main cinematographer.  “Back To God’s Country” was a major Canadian and international silent film hit. Nell also played the lead in the film which featured a controversial though very brief nude scene. One of the promotional advertisements for the film had a line drawing of a nude Nell from the back frolicking with several animals. Part of the caption read: “Don’t book Back To God’s Country unless you want to prove the Nude is NOT Rude.” \\nAlthough the movie was extremely successful and brought in a 300% profit, no further investments were forthcoming. As well, Curwood was infuriated with Nell because she changed the scenario of his short story. She adapted the protagonist of the film from the Great Dane, Wapi to the female lead, Delores. Shipman also shaped her character into a heroine: she saved the male lead and in so doing created an independent character and feminist role model. \\nAfter shooting Back to God’s Country, Nell and co-star Bert Van Tuyle, with whom she was having an affair, moved back to Hollywood where she subsequently divorced Ernest Shipman.  During this period, Nell created “Nell Shipman Productions” with Van Tuyle and established herself as an independent producer. She focused on the major themes she enjoyed: wild animals, nature, feminist heroes, and filming on location. She produced, wrote, co-directed and starred in The Girl From God’s Country (1921) and The Grub Stake (1923). Both films were successful. \\nWhile living in Spokane, Washington, Nell Shipman made a film called The Grub Stake, which costs around $180,000 to produce. Unfortunately, the film was never distributed. The American distributor went bankrupt and during subsequent litigation, the film became tied up in the legal proceedings. During this time, Nell tried to maintain her production company and after transporting her entire zoo on barges up to Priest Lake, Idaho, she made several short films at Lion Head Lodge. Unfortunately, life was difficult as Van Tuyle became increasingly unstable and by hostile locals who killed her animals.  In a scenario reminiscent of one of her films, Nell and Bert got lost in the wild for two days during a violent snow storm in early 1924. However, they managed to escape death when they were saved by two brothers, Joseph and Fred Gumaer. \\nLater that same year, Nell ‘s company went bankrupt and she broke up with Van Tuyle.  She was forced to send her animals to the San Diego Zoo because of her inability to pay the maintenance costs. Nell next moved across the country and traveled the world. Eventually, she started writing scripts and short stories. The most notable contribution at this time was the story which became the basis of Wings in the Dark starring Myrna Loy and Cary Grant (1934). Nell finally moved to the California desert and continued writing there for the rest of her life. For the remainder of their respective careers, neither Nell nor Ernest had been able to duplicate the success of Back to God’s Country. Ernest died at the age of 53 due to cirrhosis of the liver. Their son, Barry was an actor and a singer. He married actress, Beulah McDonald, in 1934 and went on to have a successful career as a writer for movies serials, television and feature films. \\nNell Shipman’s Nell’s last major project was her autobiography, The Silent Screen and My Talking Heart, published posthumously by Boise State University through their Hemingway Western Studies Series. The university also houses the Nell Shipman Collection at Albertsons Library. Many of her films were preserved and are available through the library.

Смазывание изображения, наблюдаемого через окуляр на освещённой электролампой киноплёнке, предотвращалось обтюратором с малым углом раскрытия. Эдисон планировал также создать кинетоскоп для просмотра объёмных изображений по аналогии с появившимся стереоскопом, но из-за начавшейся конкуренции с другими устройствами, вскоре отказался от этой идеи. Одним из главных недостатков конструкции, обусловившим индивидуальный способ просмотра, была низкая световая эффективность. Из-за непрерывного движения киноплёнки мимо окуляра, кинетоскоп требовал очень коротких вспышек света для получения хотя бы относительной устойчивости изображения. Это лишало возможности обеспечить достаточную яркость при проекции на экран. Предпринятые после первых успехов аппарата Эдисона многочисленные попытки других изобретателей усовершенствовать его, увенчались появлением «Синематографа» братьев Люмьер, в котором плёнка двигалась прерывисто при помощи грейфера. Акционерное общество «Кинетоскоп» снимало фильмы для своих аппаратов с помощью «Кинетографа», но для просмотра впоследствии оказались пригодны также киноролики, снятые другими устройствами. Формат 35-мм киноплёнки, впервые разработанный Эдисоном для кинетоскопа, быстро стал всеобщим стандартом и позволил осуществлять обмен фильмами, изготовленными различными аппаратами. В момент появления технологии теоретических обоснований частоты съёмки и проекции ещё не существовало, поэтому скорость киноплёнки варьировалась в аппаратах в пределах 30 — 40 кадров в секунду. При просмотре, благодаря инерции зрения, создавалось впечатление движущегося изображения. Ролик киноплёнки «Кодак-Эдисон» стандартной длины 50 футов при частоте показа 40 кадров в секунду имел продолжительность не более 20 секунд. Некоторые фильмы снимались и демонстрировались при пониженной частоте, поскольку киноплёнка большей длины не выпускалась. Считается, что ролик про атлета Сандова из «первой десятки» кинопроката Эдисона был снят со скоростью 16 кадров в секунду, чтобы удлинить время просмотра до 50 секунд.\")])\n},function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Коммерческое использование\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nПатентную заявку на изобретение Эдисон подал 31 июля 1891 года, хотя аппарат ещё находился на стадии лабораторных испытаний и не был готов для серийного производства. Незадолго до этого — 20 мая — в лаборатории состоялась первая публичная демонстрация изготовленного прототипа для 150 участниц Федерации женских клубов США. Показанный ролик впоследствии получил название «Приветствие Диксона». Восторг публики, впервые увидевшей движущиеся фотографии, убедил авторов изобретения в целесообразности его коммерческого использования. В 1892 году было создано «Акционерное общество Кинетоскоп», получившее монополию на распространение аппаратов и технологии на территории США.\\n14 марта 1893 года патент на «Кинетоскоп» был получен и вскоре аппарат экспонировался на выставке в Чикаго. 9 мая состоялась первая демонстрация серийного устройства в Институте Искусства и Науки в Бруклине. Первым фильмом, представленным публике стала «Сцена с кузнецами», снятая в новой студии. Последним штрихом была установка на кинетоскопах автоматического монетоприёмника: так Эдисон, проделавший до этого то же самое с фонографом, оказался одним из изобретателей торговых автоматов. 14 апреля 1894 года коммерсанты братья Холланд открыли на Бродвее «кабину» (англ. Kinetoscope Parlor), в которой были установлены десять кинетоскопов, предназначенных для индивидуального просмотра. Аппараты, установленные по пять штук в два ряда, показывали разные фильмы, и каждый зритель за 25 центов мог посмотреть ролики одного ряда, а за полдоллара — все десять. Кинетоскопы были куплены у лабораторий Эдисона по цене 200 долларов за штуку акционерным обществом во главе с Норманом Раффом и Фрэнком Гаммоном, компаньоном которых стал Эндрю Холланд, один из владельцев кинозала. В первую программу вошли десять фильмов: «Парикмахерская», «Кузнецы», «Петушиный бой», «Подковывание лошади», «Горные танцы», «Трапеция», «Борьба», два ролика о британской акробатке Эне Бертольди и один об упражнениях атлета Сандова. К 1 июня Холланды открыли аналогичные заведения в Чикаго и Сан-Франциско, а 17 октября появился первый зал за пределами США — в Лондоне. В акционерное общество начали вступать десятки новых компаний, желающих распространять аттракцион, приносящий немедленную прибыль. Только за 11 первых месяцев эксплуатации кинетоскопы принесли доход в размере 150 тысяч долларов.\\nУже за полтора года до первой демонстрации фильма Люмьерами на большом экране в парижском «Гран-кафе», Эдисон положил начало кинопрокату, создав целую сеть кинозалов. Кинетоскопы быстро стали популярны у публики, но рассматривание изображения через окуляр не отвечало нынешним представлениям о кинозрелище, подразумевающим одновременный просмотр несколькими зрителями. Кроме того, большинство сюжетов были примитивны и повторяли тематику, общепринятую для зоотропов. Каталог кинороликов для кинетоскопа, насчитывавший в конце 1894 года 60 наименований, в основном состоял из фильмов о дрессированных животных, акробатах, танцах и борьбе. Все фильмы имели стандартную длину 50 футов и снимались с таким расчётом, чтобы сюжет мог быть склеен в кольцо, повторяясь бесконечно. В результате, аппарат за счёт многопетельного лентопротяжного тракта не требовал перезарядки. Одним из самых известных роликов стал «Танец Лои Фуллер», который считается первым в истории колоризованным фильмом. В июле 1894 года зафиксирован первый случай киноцензуры: владелец зала в Сан-Франциско был арестован на месяц за «неприличный киносеанс», во время которого демонстрировался фильм «Карменсита». Однако, подобные инциденты не помешали появлению роликов, специально отснятых для залов с табличкой «Только для мужчин»: в этих фильмах, пользовавшихся большим успехом, хористки задирали юбки, танцуя канкан.\")])\n},function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Проецирующий кинетоскоп\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nУспешная экспансия «Синематографа» сделала очевидной необходимость создания собственной технологии, позволяющей получать изображение на экране. Появившийся позднее «Мутоскоп», несмотря на сходный метод индивидуального просмотра через окуляр, оказался дешевле и удачнее кинетоскопа, предопределив его коммерческий провал. Поэтому, уже в 1895 году Эдисон под маркой «Витаско́п» (англ. Vitascope) начал продавать созданное Чарльзом Дженкинсоном (англ. Charles Francis Jenkins) и Томасом Арматом (англ. Thomas Armat) устройство для проекции фильмов на большие экраны. В процессе эксплуатации выявился ряд недостатков этих кинопроекторов, заставивших Эдисона предпринять усилия для собственных разработок. В результате с ноября 1896 года компания приступила к выпуску нового устройства для проекции фильмов «Проджектоскоп» (англ. Projectoscope).\\nВ 1912 году Эдисон выпустил на рынок «Проджектоскоп» для любительского использования в домашних условиях. На негорючей киноплёнке нового формата шириной 22-мм для такого проджектоскопа изображение располагалось на трёх дорожках кадров размером 4×6 мм. Проекция происходила последовательно с реверсом механизма: сначала при прямом ходе проецировался первый ряд, затем при обратном — второй, расположенный в середине, и в конце — третий снова в прямом направлении. Технология не получила распространения, уступая в удобстве появившимся двумя годами ранее 28-мм любительским проекторам «Pathé KOK». Через четыре года компания Эдисона вышла на рынок со своей последней технологией кинопроекции «Супер Кинетоскоп», так же не получившей распространения из-за жёсткой конкуренции с более удачными проекторами.\")])\n},function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Кинетофон\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nИдея создания устройства, способного воспроизводить звук одновременно с изображением, появилась раньше, чем начались разработки кинетографа и кинетоскопа, задуманных Эдисоном, как приставка к изобретённому им ранее фонографу. В 1894 году он писал:\\n\\nВ 1887 году мне пришла мысль о возможности сконструировать аппарат, который будет для зрения тем же, чем является фонограф для слуха, и который будет и записывать и воспроизводить одновременно звук и движение\\n\\nВ марте 1895 года завершено создание аппарата, представляющего из себя помещённые в один корпус кинетоскоп и фонограф с общим приводом лентопротяжного механизма и звукового цилиндра под названием «Кинетофон» (англ. kinetophone)[17]. Первым известным звуковым фильмом является снятая в 1894 году или в самом начале 1895 года на студии Эдисона в Уэст-Орандже запись, ныне известная как «Экспериментальный звуковой фильм Диксона». Синхронная съёмка фильмов для кинетофона была затруднена по многим причинам, главными из которых были низкая чувствительность мембраны фонографа и необходимость использования громоздких рупоров, неизбежно видимых в кадре, как в упомянутом фильме. Точность синхронизации оставалась низкой, исключая совпадение артикуляции с речевой фонограммой. Поэтому большинство звуковых кинороликов представляли собой ритмические действия, происходящие под музыку, записанную отдельно от изображения. Демонстраторы могли подобрать к каждому фильму звуковое сопровождение из широкого спектра поставлявшихся валиков фонографа, задавая подходящий темп. Невысокая громкость допускала только индивидуальное прослушивание звука через первые в мире внутриканальные наушники, что хорошо сочеталось с конструкцией кинетоскопа, но было неприемлемо при проекции на большой экран. В результате, кинетофон устарел одновременно с кинетоскопом, вытесненным с рынка кинопроекторами различных систем. Было выпущено не более двух-трёх дюжин аппаратов, не имевших коммерческого успеха.\\nДальнейшие попытки объединить изображение со звуком предпринимались уже с проецирующим кинетоскопом. В 1913 году технология была продемонстрирована за пределами США, в том числе в Москве и Санкт-Петербурге, где была встречена неоднозначно. Однако, на тот момент уже существовала аналогичная система звукового кино «Гомон Хронофон» компании Gaumont, использующая более современные грампластинки вместо устаревших валиков.\")])\n},function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Kinetoscope\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nThe Kinetoscope is an early motion picture exhibition device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window at the top of the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was copied by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892.[1] Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.\\nA prototype for the Kinetoscope was shown to a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope was held at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.\")])\n},function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Projecting Kinetoscopes\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nOver the course of 1895, it became clear that the Kinetoscope was going to lose out on one end to projected motion pictures and, on the other, to a new \\\"peep show\\\" device, the cheap, flip-book-based Mutoscope. In its second year of commercialization, the Kinetoscope operation's profits plummeted by more than 95 percent, to just over $4,000. The Latham brothers and their father, Woodville, had retained the services of former Edison employee Eugene Lauste and then, in April 1895, Dickson himself to develop a film projection system. On May 20, in New York City, the new Eidoloscope was used for the first commercial screening of a motion picture: a boxing match between Young Griffo and Charles Barnett, four or eight minutes long. European inventors, most prominently the Lumières and Germany's Skladanowsky brothers, were moving forward with similar systems.\\nBy the beginning of 1896, Edison had turned his attention to promoting a projector technology, the Phantoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator.  With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals. \\nAs far back as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had screened films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; in the style of the Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of The Great Train Robbery (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.\")])\n}]}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 111 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports={render:function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('div', {\n

В отличие от современного кинопроектора кинетоскоп не давал возможности коллективного просмотра на экране, а был предназначен для индивидуального зрителя, наблюдавшего изображение через окуляр.</p>\r\n<p><b>Принцип действия</b><br>\r\nКинетоскоп представлял из себя деревянный ящик, внутри которого была натянута на роликах киноплёнка, непрерывно движущаяся мимо окуляра, расположенного на верхней крышке аппарата. Смазывание изображения, наблюдаемого через окуляр на освещённой электролампой киноплёнке, предотвращалось обтюратором с малым углом раскрытия. Эдисон планировал также создать кинетоскоп для просмотра объёмных изображений по аналогии с появившимся стереоскопом, но из-за начавшейся конкуренции с другими устройствами, вскоре отказался от этой идеи. Одним из главных недостатков конструкции, обусловившим индивидуальный способ просмотра, была низкая световая эффективность. Из-за непрерывного движения киноплёнки мимо окуляра, кинетоскоп требовал очень коротких вспышек света для получения хотя бы относительной устойчивости изображения. Это лишало возможности обеспечить достаточную яркость при проекции на экран. Предпринятые после первых успехов аппарата Эдисона многочисленные попытки других изобретателей усовершенствовать его, увенчались появлением «Синематографа» братьев Люмьер, в котором плёнка двигалась прерывисто при помощи грейфера. Акционерное общество «Кинетоскоп» снимало фильмы для своих аппаратов с помощью «Кинетографа», но для просмотра впоследствии оказались пригодны также киноролики, снятые другими устройствами. Формат 35-мм киноплёнки, впервые разработанный Эдисоном для кинетоскопа, быстро стал всеобщим стандартом и позволил осуществлять обмен фильмами, изготовленными различными аппаратами. В момент появления технологии теоретических обоснований частоты съёмки и проекции ещё не существовало, поэтому скорость киноплёнки варьировалась в аппаратах в пределах 30 — 40 кадров в секунду. При просмотре, благодаря инерции зрения, создавалось впечатление движущегося изображения. Ролик киноплёнки «Кодак-Эдисон» стандартной длины 50 футов при частоте показа 40 кадров в секунду имел продолжительность не более 20 секунд. Некоторые фильмы снимались и демонстрировались при пониженной частоте, поскольку киноплёнка большей длины не выпускалась. Считается, что ролик про атлета Сандова из «первой десятки» кинопроката Эдисона был снят со скоростью 16 кадров в секунду, чтобы удлинить время просмотра до 50 секунд.</p>\r\n<p><b>Коммерческое использование</b><br>\r\nПатентную заявку на изобретение Эдисон подал 31 июля 1891 года, хотя аппарат ещё находился на стадии лабораторных испытаний и не был готов для серийного производства. Незадолго до этого — 20 мая — в лаборатории состоялась первая публичная демонстрация изготовленного прототипа для 150 участниц Федерации женских клубов США. Показанный ролик впоследствии получил название «Приветствие Диксона». Восторг публики, впервые увидевшей движущиеся фотографии, убедил авторов изобретения в целесообразности его коммерческого использования. В 1892 году было создано «Акционерное общество Кинетоскоп», получившее монополию на распространение аппаратов и технологии на территории США.\r\n14 марта 1893 года патент на «Кинетоскоп» был получен и вскоре аппарат экспонировался на выставке в Чикаго. 9 мая состоялась первая демонстрация серийного устройства в Институте Искусства и Науки в Бруклине. Первым фильмом, представленным публике стала «Сцена с кузнецами», снятая в новой студии. Последним штрихом была установка на кинетоскопах автоматического монетоприёмника: так Эдисон, проделавший до этого то же самое с фонографом, оказался одним из изобретателей торговых автоматов. 14 апреля 1894 года коммерсанты братья Холланд открыли на Бродвее «кабину» (англ. Kinetoscope Parlor), в которой были установлены десять кинетоскопов, предназначенных для индивидуального просмотра. Аппараты, установленные по пять штук в два ряда, показывали разные фильмы, и каждый зритель за 25 центов мог посмотреть ролики одного ряда, а за полдоллара — все десять. Кинетоскопы были куплены у лабораторий Эдисона по цене 200 долларов за штуку акционерным обществом во главе с Норманом Раффом и Фрэнком Гаммоном, компаньоном которых стал Эндрю Холланд, один из владельцев кинозала. В первую программу вошли десять фильмов: «Парикмахерская», «Кузнецы», «Петушиный бой», «Подковывание лошади», «Горные танцы», «Трапеция», «Борьба», два ролика о британской акробатке Эне Бертольди и один об упражнениях атлета Сандова. К 1 июня Холланды открыли аналогичные заведения в Чикаго и Сан-Франциско, а 17 октября появился первый зал за пределами США — в Лондоне. В акционерное общество начали вступать десятки новых компаний, желающих распространять аттракцион, приносящий немедленную прибыль. Только за 11 первых месяцев эксплуатации кинетоскопы принесли доход в размере 150 тысяч долларов.\r\nУже за полтора года до первой демонстрации фильма Люмьерами на большом экране в парижском «Гран-кафе», Эдисон положил начало кинопрокату, создав целую сеть кинозалов. Кинетоскопы быстро стали популярны у публики, но рассматривание изображения через окуляр не отвечало нынешним представлениям о кинозрелище, подразумевающим одновременный просмотр несколькими зрителями. Кроме того, большинство сюжетов были примитивны и повторяли тематику, общепринятую для зоотропов. Каталог кинороликов для кинетоскопа, насчитывавший в конце 1894 года 60 наименований, в основном состоял из фильмов о дрессированных животных, акробатах, танцах и борьбе. Все фильмы имели стандартную длину 50 футов и снимались с таким расчётом, чтобы сюжет мог быть склеен в кольцо, повторяясь бесконечно. В результате, аппарат за счёт многопетельного лентопротяжного тракта не требовал перезарядки. Одним из самых известных роликов стал «Танец Лои Фуллер», который считается первым в истории колоризованным фильмом. В июле 1894 года зафиксирован первый случай киноцензуры: владелец зала в Сан-Франциско был арестован на месяц за «неприличный киносеанс», во время которого демонстрировался фильм «Карменсита». Однако, подобные инциденты не помешали появлению роликов, специально отснятых для залов с табличкой «Только для мужчин»: в этих фильмах, пользовавшихся большим успехом, хористки задирали юбки, танцуя канкан.</p>\r\n<p><b>Проецирующий кинетоскоп</b><br>\r\nУспешная экспансия «Синематографа» сделала очевидной необходимость создания собственной технологии, позволяющей получать изображение на экране. Появившийся позднее «Мутоскоп», несмотря на сходный метод индивидуального просмотра через окуляр, оказался дешевле и удачнее кинетоскопа, предопределив его коммерческий провал. Поэтому, уже в 1895 году Эдисон под маркой «Витаско́п» (англ. Vitascope) начал продавать созданное Чарльзом Дженкинсоном (англ. Charles Francis Jenkins) и Томасом Арматом (англ. Thomas Armat) устройство для проекции фильмов на большие экраны. В процессе эксплуатации выявился ряд недостатков этих кинопроекторов, заставивших Эдисона предпринять усилия для собственных разработок. В результате с ноября 1896 года компания приступила к выпуску нового устройства для проекции фильмов «Проджектоскоп» (англ. Projectoscope).\r\nВ 1912 году Эдисон выпустил на рынок «Проджектоскоп» для любительского использования в домашних условиях. На негорючей киноплёнке нового формата шириной 22-мм для такого проджектоскопа изображение располагалось на трёх дорожках кадров размером 4×6 мм. Проекция происходила последовательно с реверсом механизма: сначала при прямом ходе проецировался первый ряд, затем при обратном — второй, расположенный в середине, и в конце — третий снова в прямом направлении. Технология не получила распространения, уступая в удобстве появившимся двумя годами ранее 28-мм любительским проекторам «Pathé KOK». Через четыре года компания Эдисона вышла на рынок со своей последней технологией кинопроекции «Супер Кинетоскоп», так же не получившей распространения из-за жёсткой конкуренции с более удачными проекторами.</p>\r\n<p><b>Кинетофон</b><br>\r\nИдея создания устройства, способного воспроизводить звук одновременно с изображением, появилась раньше, чем начались разработки кинетографа и кинетоскопа, задуманных Эдисоном, как приставка к изобретённому им ранее фонографу. В 1894 году он писал:\r\n\r\nВ 1887 году мне пришла мысль о возможности сконструировать аппарат, который будет для зрения тем же, чем является фонограф для слуха, и который будет и записывать и воспроизводить одновременно звук и движение\r\n\r\nВ марте 1895 года завершено создание аппарата, представляющего из себя помещённые в один корпус кинетоскоп и фонограф с общим приводом лентопротяжного механизма и звукового цилиндра под названием «Кинетофон» (англ. kinetophone)[17]. Первым известным звуковым фильмом является снятая в 1894 году или в самом начале 1895 года на студии Эдисона в Уэст-Орандже запись, ныне известная как «Экспериментальный звуковой фильм Диксона». Синхронная съёмка фильмов для кинетофона была затруднена по многим причинам, главными из которых были низкая чувствительность мембраны фонографа и необходимость использования громоздких рупоров, неизбежно видимых в кадре, как в упомянутом фильме. Точность синхронизации оставалась низкой, исключая совпадение артикуляции с речевой фонограммой. Поэтому большинство звуковых кинороликов представляли собой ритмические действия, происходящие под музыку, записанную отдельно от изображения. Демонстраторы могли подобрать к каждому фильму звуковое сопровождение из широкого спектра поставлявшихся валиков фонографа, задавая подходящий темп. Невысокая громкость допускала только индивидуальное прослушивание звука через первые в мире внутриканальные наушники, что хорошо сочеталось с конструкцией кинетоскопа, но было неприемлемо при проекции на большой экран. В результате, кинетофон устарел одновременно с кинетоскопом, вытесненным с рынка кинопроекторами различных систем. Было выпущено не более двух-трёх дюжин аппаратов, не имевших коммерческого успеха.\r\nДальнейшие попытки объединить изображение со звуком предпринимались уже с проецирующим кинетоскопом. В 1913 году технология была продемонстрирована за пределами США, в том числе в Москве и Санкт-Петербурге, где была встречена неоднозначно. Однако, на тот момент уже существовала аналогичная система звукового кино «Гомон Хронофон» компании Gaumont, использующая более современные грампластинки вместо устаревших валиков.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div v-if=\"$route.params.lang === 'en'\">\r\n<p><b>Kinetoscope</b><br>\r\nThe Kinetoscope is an early motion picture exhibition device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window at the top of the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was copied by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892.[1] Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.\r\nA prototype for the Kinetoscope was shown to a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope was held at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.</p>\r\n<p><b>Projecting Kinetoscopes</b><br>\r\nOver the course of 1895, it became clear that the Kinetoscope was going to lose out on one end to projected motion pictures and, on the other, to a new \"peep show\" device, the cheap, flip-book-based Mutoscope. In its second year of commercialization, the Kinetoscope operation's profits plummeted by more than 95 percent, to just over $4,000. The Latham brothers and their father, Woodville, had retained the services of former Edison employee Eugene Lauste and then, in April 1895, Dickson himself to develop a film projection system. On May 20, in New York City, the new Eidoloscope was used for the first commercial screening of a motion picture: a boxing match between Young Griffo and Charles Barnett, four or eight minutes long. European inventors, most prominently the Lumières and Germany's Skladanowsky brothers, were moving forward with similar systems.\r\nBy the beginning of 1896, Edison had turned his attention to promoting a projector technology, the Phantoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator.  With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals. \r\nAs far back as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had screened films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; in the style of the Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of The Great Train Robbery (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    export default {}\r\n</script>\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Kinetoscope.vue?7cdbdbf5","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div :class=\"'paper paper--' + $route.params.lang\">\r\n        <div class=\"paper__page\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__illustrations\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/skladanowsky/0802150014150.jpg\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/skladanowsky/16778660_303.jpg\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/skladanowsky/73855180_Max_Skladanowskyx0_0_0.jpg\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/skladanowsky/Skladanowsky_brothers.jpg\">\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div v-if=\"$route.params.lang === 'ru'\">\r\n<p><b>Макс Складановский</b><br>\r\n(30 апреля 1863, Берлин — 30 ноября 1939) — немецкий изобретатель и один из первых кинопроизводителей.

В 1890-х вместе с братом Эмилем Макс создал фотоаппарат с гибкой целлулоидной плёнкой, а в 1895 году — «Биоскоп». Он представлял собой проектор с двумя объективами и двумя полосами целлулоидной плёнки шириной 45-мм. Плёнка с кадрами размером 30×40 мм склеивалась в кольцо длиной 1,5 метра и демонстрировалась с частотой 8—10 кадров в секунду.\r\n1 ноября 1895 года братья продемонстрировали «Биоскоп» в варьете «Зимний сад» (нем. Wintergartenpalais) в Берлине. Показ рекламировался как «самое интересное изобретение нашего времени» и собирал полный зал в течение приблизительно четырех недель. Сам показ состоял из очень коротких фильмов около пяти секунд каждый, которые были склеены в кольцо и повторялись непрерывно, в сопровождении заранее подготовленного музыкального оформления. Из-за особенностей конструкции аппарат позволял демонстрировать только короткие ролики с неустойчивым изображением, быстро утомлявшим зрителей. В результате «Биоскоп» не выдержал конкуренции с «Синематографом», так и оставшись техническим аттракционом.</p>\r\n<p><b>Фильмография</b><br>\r\nЗа десять лет, начиная с 1895 года, братья Складановские отсняли не менее тридцати короткометражных фильмов.

Along with his brother Emil, he invented the Bioscop, an early movie projector the Skladanowsky brothers used to display the first moving picture show to a paying audience on November 1, 1895, just before the December 28, 1895 public debut of the Lumière Brothers' technically superior Cinématographe in Paris. (The Lumiere brothers had previously held a private debut of the Cinematographe on March 22, 1895.)</p>\r\n<p><b>Life</b><br>\r\nBorn in Pankow near Berlin to a glazier, Skladanowsky was apprenticed as a photographer and glass painter, which led to an interest in magic lanterns. In 1879, he began to tour Germany and Central Europe with his father Carl and elder brother Emil, giving dissolving magic lantern shows. In the early 1890s he built a film camera along with Emil, and in 1895 the brothers produced the Bioskop. The Bioskop, which was inspired by magic-lantern technology, used two loops of 54mm film, one frame being projected alternately from each. This made it possible for the Bioskop to project at 16 frames per second, a speed sufficient to create the illusion of movement.\r\nA demonstration of the Bioskop in Pankow, Berlin in July 1895 was witnessed by the directors of the Wintergarten music hall who contracted Skladanowsky for a sum of 2500 Goldmark to present his invention as the final act in a variety performance commencing on November 1, 1895. The show was advertised as \"the most interesting invention of the modern age\" and played to capacity crowds for around four weeks. The show itself consisted of a number of very short films of arounds six seconds each which were rear-projected and repeated a number of times to a specially composed musical accompaniment.\r\nSkladanowsky's invention was booked to play the Folies Bergère in Paris from January 1896, but after the Lumière Brothers unveiled their technically superior Cinématographe show in December 1895, his contract was cancelled. Skladanowsky witnessed a performance of the Cinématographe and continued to make technical improvements to his projector and camera, touring Germany, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia throughout 1896, presenting his last show in Stettin on March 30, 1897. These later shows used a more sophisticated system with a single band of film and a geneva drive mechanism, but Skladanowsky had to stop exhibiting as the authorities refused to renew his trade licence as \"too many film licences were already in number of films in the early twentieth century, some directed by Eugen, his younger brother, but with little success. In his later years Skladanowsky was accused in the press of exaggerating his role in the early days of cinema, most notably by the pioneering cameraman Guido Seeber.circulation\"\r\nAfter this Skladanowsky returned to his former photographic activities including the production of flip books and further magic lantern shows. He also sold amateur film cameras and projectors and produced 3-D anaglyph image slides. His company Projektion für Alle also produced a number of films in the early 20th century, some directed by Eugen, his younger brother, but with little success. In his later years Skladanowsky was accused in the press of exaggerating his role in the early days of cinema, most notably by the pioneering cameraman Guido Seeber.</p>\r\n<p><b>Legacy</b><br>\r\nBetween the years 1895 to 1905, the brothers directed at least 25 to 30 short movies.  In 1995, the German filmmaker Wim Wenders directed a drama documentary film Die Gebrüder Skladanowsky in collaboration with students of the Munich Academy for Television and Film in which Max Skladanowsky was played by Udo Kier.</p>\r\n<p><b>Filmography</b><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1895 — Bauerntanz zweier Kinder</li>\r\n<li>1895 — Komisches Reck</li>\r\n<li>1895 — Serpentinen Tanz</li>\r\n<li>1895 — Der Jongleur Paul Petras</li>\r\n<li>1895 — Das Boxende Känguruh</li>\r\n<li>1895 — Akrobatisches Potpourri</li>\r\n<li>1895 — Kamarinskaja</li>\r\n<li>1895 — Ringkämpfer</li>\r\n<li>1895 — Apotheose</li>\r\n<li>1896 — Unter den Linden</li>\r\n<li>1896 — Nicht mehr allein</li>\r\n<li>1896 — Mit Ablösung der Wache</li>\r\n<li>1896 — Lustige Gesellschaft vor dem Tivoli in Kopenhagen</li>\r\n<li>1896 — Leben und Treiben am Alexanderplatz</li>\r\n<li>1896 — Komishe Begenung im Tiergarten zu Stockholm</li>\r\n<li>1896 — Ausfahrt nach dem Alarm</li>\r\n<li>1896 — Ankunft eines Eisenbahnzuges</li>\r\n<li>1896 — Alarm der Feuerwehr</li>\r\n<li>1896 — Die Wachtparade</li>\r\n<li>1897 — Am Bollwerk in Stettin</li>\r\n<li>1897 — Apotheose II</li>\r\n<li>1897 — Am Bollwerk</li>\r\n<li>1900 — Eine Moderne Jungfrau von Orleans</li>\r\n<li>1905 — Eine Fliegenjagd oder Die Rache der Frau Schultze</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    export default {}\r\n</script>\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Skladanowsky.vue?0feb0769","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div :class=\"'paper paper--' + $route.params.lang\">\r\n        <div class=\"paper__page\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__illustrations\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/theatre/theatre_optique.jpg\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/theatre/mid_theatr.jpg\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/theatre/1-kOdEZcNHiykwguVJNZCumQ.png\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../assets/images/theatre/praxinoscope.jpg\">\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div v-if=\"$route.params.lang === 'ru'\">\r\n<p>Историки кино считают, что первый показ мультипликационного фильма состоялся до рождения игрового кино, в 1892, когда Эмиль Рейно представил изумленной публике, собравшейся в парижском музее Гревен, свои «светящиеся пантомимы».\r\nЕще раньше, в 1876, Рейно изобрел свой праксиноскоп — аппарат, при помощи которого можно было рассматривать движущиеся изображения.\r\nВзяв за основу зоотроп, Рейно усовершенствовал его, соединив с волшебным фонарем, что позволяло насладиться зрелищем уже не одному-единственному зрителю, а многим одновременно.\r\nРейно придумал заменить цилиндр аппарата мягкой лентой, на которой были укреплены желатиновые пластинки размером 4x5 см; эти картинки через помещенное в центре зеркало отображались на экране.\r\nКроме того, Рейно первым стал использовать постоянную декорацию, рисуя ее отдельно от персонажей и передавая на экран посредством отдельного волшебного фонаря.\r\nОн был и первым, кто синхронизировал изображение и звук, причем музыкальное сопровождение для своих фильмов сочинял тоже сам.\r\nДля каждого фильма Рейно рисовал около полутора тысяч картинок; сеанс в музее Гревен продолжался около пятнадцати минут, и таких сеансов Рейно давал два-три за вечер, иногда четыре или пять.\r\nПо контракту он должен был ежегодно обновлять программу, что требовало от него поистине титанического труда.\r\nВ первую программу Рейно входили фильмы «Кружка пива» (Un Bon Bock, 1891), «Клоун с собачками», (Clown Et Ses Chiens, 1892) и «Бедный Пьеро» (Pauvre Pierrot, 1891).\r\nВ 1893—1894 Рейно создал свой шедевр «Вокруг кабины» — пляжную историю, центром которой была ссора между добропорядочным парижанином и любителем подсматривать за хорошенькими купальщицами.\r\nРождение в 1895 кинематографа оказалось для Рейно роковым.\r\nОн пытался в своих фильмах заменить рисунки фотографиями, но безуспешно.\r\nРейно, доведенный до отчаяния и совершенно разоренный, разломал свой аппарат и выбросил в Сену ленты.\r\nУцелели только «Бедный Пьеро» и «Вокруг кабины» (Autour dun cabine).</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div v-if=\"$route.params.lang === 'en'\">\r\n<p>The Théâtre Optique was a moving picture show presented by Charles-Émile Reynaud in 1892, based on the praxinoscope that allows to offer a show from the projection of mobile cartoons lasting between six and fifteen minutes. This is he combination of a magic lantern which projected images in the background of the scene, and another one which projected the figures painted by mirrors and lenses in plates in a band of perforated film. This is one of the precedents of the cinematographer although the images had to be drawn by hand on the film and it was the first presentation of projected moving images to an audience, predating Auguste and Louis Lumière's first public performance by three years.</p>\r\n<p><b>History</b><br>\r\nIn 1876, Reynaud, a French inventor, had created the Praxinoscope, an improvement of the Zoetrope. The Praxinoscope replaced the narrow viewing slits of the Zoetrope with an inner circle of 12 mirrors (equal to the number of images), allowing a clearer and less distorted view of the moving image. Several people could watch the performance at the same time. After Reynaud licensed his invention in 1877, it sold well in a number of the large Paris department stores.\r\nIn 1878, Reynaud produced the Praxinoscope Theatre. This improved version included a glass viewing screen which allowed the moving image to be superimposed over a changeable background. He continued to improve the design and in 1880 created the first projection version.\r\nIn 1888, he improved the projection version, which was a similar projectors desing which would be used for cinema projection a few years later. Glass plates, individually painted by Reynaud himself, were mounted in leather bands. Each of the bands were connected by a metal strip with a hole, which allowed it to locate on a pin on the rotating drum and align the image with the projecting lantern. Reynaud presented the patent of its Théâtre Optique the December 1, 1888 and it differentiates of the optical toys (<!--Phenocytoscope, -->Zoetrope, Praxinoscope or Zoopraxiscope) because it was designed to obtain the illusion of movement with a great variety of animation scenes, which go on for a long time, and it was not limited to a continuous repetition of the same images. \r\nOn October 28, 1892 he gave his first public performance of a moving picture show at the Musée Grévin in Paris. The show, billed as Pantomimes Lumineuses, included three cartoons, Pauvre Pierrot, Un bon bock, and Le Clown et ses chiens. Reynaud acted as the projectionist and the show was accompanied by a piano player. Although the films shown by the Lumière Brothers in 1895 eclipsed it, the show stayed at the Musée Grévin until 1900 and over 500,000 people had seen it.\r\nReynaud ended up ruined and forgotten. One of the reasons for his short fame was that the size of his film tapes were too big to make copies. In 1913 Reynaud throw himself to the Seine with his last copy of a Théâtre Optique, although a few days later he would be visited by a French inventor and producer Léon Gaumont, to buy the invention and donate it to the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers.</p>\r\n<p><b>Pantomimes Lumineuses</b><br>\r\nThe first show that included moving images was performed at the Grévin museum in Paris in 1892, a few years before the Lumière brothers made their first projection. Reynaud's works can be considered animations and their Pantomimes Lumineuses the first animated films. More than 12,800 representations, which attended more than half a million people, were made until it closed in 1900.\r\nThe performances could last one minute and a half or five minutes the longest, and they could be longer depending on the operator's movements with the coils.\r\nThe Grévin Museum signed a contract to represent the Pantomimes to Charles-Émile Reynaud, who linked it to represent the show in two shifts with the frequency demanded by the public, from 15h to 18h and from 20h to 23h and forced to modify it to least once a year.</p>\r\n<p><b>Shows</b><br>\r\nThe first programme included three shows. The first one was Pauvre Pierrot! with Gaston Paulin on the piano and a series of scores were created for the projections, so we can that these were the first soundtracks. The film had a lenght of 36 meters and there were 500 images in total, which in the public saw the dispute of the protagonist, Pierrot, with Arlequine by the love of Colombine, but this one ignored Pierrot and in the end he got the love of Arlequine. The story was so successful in its premiere in 1892 that it was a work projected until February 1892.\r\nThe second performance was Le Clown et ses chiens, of 22 meters and 300 images, where the protagonist, a clown, did a circus numbers with their dogs.\r\nFinally, the third was Un bon bock, which had 50 meters lenght and 700 images, showed a rude man who entered a bar and watched his beer disappearing in front of him.\r\nLater, Charles-Émile Reynaud created other shows like: Autour d'une cabine, which had 45 meters and 636 images, and it explained the story of a bather women molested by a shameless man in front of her husband; another well-known work is A rêve au coin du feu, which had 29 meters and 400 images, where the use of a flashback was used for the first time as a narrative element to explain the past of the protagonist when his house was devoured by the flames.</p>\r\n<p><b>Operation</b><br>\r\nCharles-Émile Reynaud used the combination of two magic lanterns to make his shows. The first one projected to the bottom of the scene and the second one that projected the painted images, by means of mirrors and diverse lenses, in the plates of the band of fabric pierced in two coils that moved manually.\r\nReynaud used a strip of cloth, with the sides of the tape reinforced with metallic bands and flexible, about 70 mm with lacquer rubber plates protected with gelatin, making the whole process a very tedious and complicated work. The bands had a central perforation between each of the drawings in order to be able to drive the film through the drag. Although the mechanism was actuated by a cylinder of the mirror through a pegs.\r\nThe ribbon of the film was the flexible strip which was made of plates and placed inside the first coil, then the film was advancing in front of the magic lantern, guided by the central perforations in the ribbon until reaching the cylinder of 36 Rotating mirrors. The film was received by a second coil which the operator had to rotate simultaneously and passed about 15 images per second, depending on the speed of the operator. The PHI phenomenon prolonged the image display. The light that came to the mirrors was led, through other mirrors, to the rear of the projection screen.\r\nThe figures of his representations were painted by hand on a photosensitive support with transparent inks with aniline, a technique that was already used for magic lantern shows. All the outline of the characters and their support was painted with black ink so that the light did not pass between the glass.\r\nOn the other hand, the decoration and the landscape behind the figures was designed and painted on another glass plate and projected with the other magic lantern.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    export default {}\r\n</script>\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Theatre.vue?795835f8","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class=\"title\">\r\n            <div>{{ names[0] }}\\</div>\r\n            <div>\\{{ names[1] }}</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"paper paper--person\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/heroes/aoki.png\">\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<p><b>Tsuru Aoki</b> (September 9, 1892 – October 18, 1961) was a popular Japanese stage and screen actress whose career was most prolific during the silent film era of the 1910s through the 1920s. Aoki may have been the first Asian actress to garner top-billing in American motion pictures.</p>\r\n<p><b>Life and career</b><br>\r\nBorn in Tokyo, Japan, Aoki emigrated to Los Angeles, California in 1903 with her aunt and uncle, Otojirō Kawakami, who had previously owned a theatrical group called “Kawakami-za” in Japan. Aoki was later adopted by another uncle Aoki Toshio and relocated to San Francisco. Toshio worked as a sketch artist for a local newspaper. Tsuru Aoki started taking lessons in ballet dance in New York, when she went along with her uncle Toshio, who was hired by David Belasco for The Darling of the Gods. After Toshio’s death a reporter looked after Aoki.  Aoki began her acting career after returning to Los Angeles and performing in stage productions in the city’s Japanese Theatre where she was noticed by film producer Thomas Ince who placed the young actress under contract. She was also responsible for recruiting Japanese actors for Imperial Japanese Company, a subsidiary of New York Motion Picture Corporation.  Aoki made her film debut in the Majestic film studios release The Oath of Tsuru San in 1913 opposite actor William Garwood. Her follow-up film was the 1914 Ince produced O Mimi San, which starred the American child actress Mildred Harris and a handsome young newcomer named Sessue Hayakawa, whom Aoki had acted with onstage at the Japanese Theatre the previous year. The couple began a romantic relationship that would culminate in their marriage on May 1, 1914, just weeks before the release of their critically acclaimed and publicly successful film The Wrath of the Gods – a melodrama about an interracial romance between a man portrayed by Caucasian actor/director Frank Borzage and an Asian woman portrayed by Aoki. The film also starred Sessue Hayakawa and featured actress Gladys Brockwell. Hayakawa and Aoki would eventually make more than twenty films together throughout the 1910s and 1920s.\r\nOne of Aoki’s most recalled films of the silent period is the 1919 William Worthington-directed The Dragon Painter, in which Aoki starred, playing a young woman who convinces an isolated, mentally deranged artist named Tatsu (portrayed by Hayakawa) to come down from the mountains so that she may civilize him and he may further his artistic abilities. Other notable films of the period were The Typhoon (1914), The Vigil (1914), The Geisha (1914), The Chinatown Mystery (1915), His Birthright (1918), and The Breath of the Gods (1920). Throughout the 1910s, Aoki would appear in approximately forty films, often in leading-lady roles which was a first for an Asian actress. Some of her co-stars of the era included such notable names as Marin Sais, Frank Borzage, Gladys Brockwell, Mildred Harris, Jack Holt, Jane Wolfe, Dagmar Godowsky, Vola Vale, Florence Vidor, Earle Foxe, and Walter Long. After a series of moderately successful Ince-produced two-reel serials, Aoki’s career in the United States began to falter (while her husband’s career began to build momentum), and the couple travelled to France in 1923 and filmed the popular Édouard-Émile Violet-directed drama La Bataille. After returning to America, however, Aoki made only three more films before retiring from the screen to raise her and Hayakawa’s three adopted children. Her last silent screen performance was the 1924 release The Danger Line. Aoki would only return to the screen in 1960 (her first talkie) to once again appear with her husband in the drama Hell to Eternity. She died the following year in Japan of acute peritonitis at the age of 69.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import Heroes from '../../heroes.js'\r\n\r\n    export default { data() { \r\n        return { names: Heroes.filter(h => h.id === 'aoki')[0].names } \r\n    } }\r\n</script>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Aoki.vue?39c84a0b","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class=\"title\">\r\n            <div>{{ names[0] }}\\</div>\r\n            <div>\\{{ names[1] }}</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"paper paper--person\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/heroes/falconetti.png\">\r\n<p><b>Рене Жанна Фалько&shy;нетти</b> (фр.

Одним из «кумиров» Фальконетти была Габриэль Режан.\r\nНа театральных подмостках — с 1913 года.\r\nВ 29 мая 1915 года выступила на сцене «Одеона» в чеховском «Предложении», — и получила приглашение заключить трёхгодичный контракт с театром.\r\nВ конце 1920-го играла в знаменитом «экзотическом» спектакле Гастона Бати «Самум» (по пьесе Анри-Рене Ленормана, Комеди Монтень), а через два месяца стала партнёршей Люсьена Гитри в не менее знаменитом «Комедианте» (Театр Эдуарда VII, 1921), театральной оде Саша Гитри своему отцу.\r\nС 1924 года — Мадемуазель Фальконетти пансионер в труппе Комеди Франсез.\r\nВ 1926 году произвела фурор и была причислена к иконам стиля «бурных двадцатых»[5], исполнив главную роль в инсценировке гиперскандального романа Виктора Маргерита «Холостячка» (фр. «La Garçonne», «Театр дё Пари», 12 июля). В следующем году имела успех в роли Лоренцо («Лоренцаччо», по пьесе Мюссе; Театр Монте-Карло; Театр Мадлен, 1927).\r\nЕщё в 1917 году снялась во второстепенных ролях в фильмах Мориса дё Фероди «Клоун» и «Графиня дё Сомрив» Жоржа Денола (англ.)русск. и Жана Кемма. В 1926-м её приметил в театре К.-Т. Дрейер и предложил заглавную роль в своём будущем фильме. Роль Жанны оказалась последней в кинематографической карьере Фальконетти: методы, использованные Дрейером, привели актрису к тяжёлому нервному срыву.\r\nВ 1929 собрала собственный театральный коллектив, выступавший на сцене «Театра дё л’Авеню» (1929—1930). Первым спектаклем её труппы стала постановка пьесы Киршона и А.Успенского «Ржавчина» («Константин Терёхин») — Мария Фальконетти (так именовала она себя с 1928 года) играла роль молодой советской женщины Нины Верганской в режиссуре известного журналиста Фернана Нозьера (фр. Fernand Nozière) и Николая Евреинова. Это была первая постановка советской пьесы во Франции.\r\nСинтетическая актриса, в 1930-е она с равным успехом выступала в глубоко драматических ролях (Федра, Маргарита Готье, Лоренцо, Жанна д’Арк, Андромаха) и комедийных, участвовала в музыкальных варьете. Играла в спектаклях Саша Гитри, Жоржа Питоева, Луи Жуве. Ролью Андромахи в пьесе Жироду «Троянской войны не будет» Фальконетти намеревалась завершить свою сценическую карьеру, она переехала в Швейцарию, брала уроки вокального мастерства в Риме.\r\nПосле германского вторжения во Францию в 1940 г., предприняла попытку перебраться с сыном в Аргентину, однако из-за проблем с визами смогла добраться до Буэнос-Айреса только в июне 1943 (через Испанию и Бразилию). В столице Аргентины, при активной дружеской поддержке Габриэлы Мистраль и финансовом содействии французских эмигрантов, она руководила любительским театром, где ставились «Залог» и «Обмен» Клоделя, «Священные чудовища» Кокто. В постановке театром «Детского карнавала», пьесы её друга Сен-Жоржа де Буэлье, с которой когда-то зачиналась её театральная слава субреток и инженю в «Одеоне», Мария Фальконетти выбрала для себя роль Матери.\r\nСкончалась в Буэнос-Айресе утром 12 декабря 1946. Прах её был перевезён на Кладбище Монмартр.</p>\r\n<p><b>Оценка</b><br>\r\nМногие критики отмечают необычайную выразительность игры Фальконетти в фильме Дрейера. Режиссёр не использовал грим; в сцене перед казнью Жанны волосы актрисы действительно были острижены. Поскольку в «Страстях» режиссёр постоянно использовал крупные планы, создавалось особое, интимное взаимодействие между актрисой и зрителем; лицо Фальконетти-Жанны всё время находилось в кадре, зритель наблюдал не только страдания героини, но и самой исполнительницы, прошедшей через полтора года мучительных съёмок.\r\n«Гениальная простота игры Фальконетти потрясала зрителей. Актриса настолько вошла в свою роль, что в кадрах истязаний Жанны д’Арк впадала в обморочное состояние, представляя себе мысленно боль, причиняемую орудиями пыток. Она плакала во время съёмок допроса без всякого принуждения со стороны режиссёра — только потому, что жила внутренней жизнью своей героини».\r\nПо словам кинокритика Полин Кейл, работа Фальконетти в фильме Дрейера — «возможно, самая лучшая актёрская игра, когда-либо заснятая на плёнку».</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<p><b>Renée Jeanne Falconetti</b>  (July 21, 1892 – December 12, 1946), sometimes credited as Maria Falconetti,  Marie Falconetti,  Renée Maria Falconetti,  or, simply, Falconetti, was a French stage and film actress, notable for her role as Joan of Arc in Carl Theodor Dreyer’s 1928 silent film, La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc.\r\nBorn in Pantin, Seine-Saint-Denis, Falconetti became a stage actress in Paris in 1918. By the time Dreyer watched her act in an amateur theater and selected her as his leading lady in his upcoming production La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc, she was already a celebrated stage artiste, and had appeared in one film, La Comtesse de Somerive (1917), directed by Georges Denola and Jean Kemm. Falconetti was 35 years old when she played the role of 19-year-old Joan of Arc in La Passion. Her portrayal is widely considered one of the most astonishing performances ever committed to film, and it would remain her final cinematic role.\r\nMany writers have claimed that Falconetti’s performance was the result of extreme cruelty at the hands of Dreyer, a notoriously demanding director who pushed her to the brink of emotional collapse. For example, film critic Roger Ebert writes,\r\nFor Falconetti, the performance was an ordeal. Legends from the set tell of Dreyer forcing her to kneel painfully on stone and then wipe all expression from her face – so that the viewer would read suppressed or inner pain. He filmed the same shots again and again, hoping that in the editing room he could find exactly the right nuance in her facial expression. \r\nHowever, in their biography of Dreyer, Jean and Dale Drum say that these stories are based only on rumour and that “there is no evidence that Dreyer could be called a sadist”.  They quote onlookers who described Dreyer’s working relationship with Falconetti: initially in the production process, “Dreyer and Falconetti would watch the rushes of a single scene together, seven or eight times, until Dreyer could pick out a little bit, maybe a few feet, where the effect was what they wanted, and when they reshot the scene, she could play it without the least inhibition. Just those few feet of film had inspired her.” Later, Falconetti became able to play scenes only from Dreyer’s explanations, without the need even for rehearsal. \r\nSubsequent career \r\nAfter filming Joan of Arc, Falconetti continued with her career as a producer of light stage comedies, appearing with the Comédie-Française. During the Second World War, she escaped from France first to Switzerland, and then left for Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Falconetti had suffered from mental illness all her life, and in 1946 she died in Brazil, allegedly due to a self-imposed restrictive diet after having become significantly overweight.  Her remains are interred at Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. Her grandson Gérard Falconetti also became an actor.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import Heroes from '../../heroes.js'\r\n\r\n    export default { data() { \r\n        return { names: Heroes.filter(h => h.id === 'falconetti')[0].names } \r\n    } }\r\n</script>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Falconetti.vue?58512d04","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class=\"title\">\r\n            <div>{{ names[0] }}\\</div>\r\n            <div>\\{{ names[1] }}</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"paper paper--person\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/heroes/hardy.png\">\r\n<p><b>Оливер Харди</b> (18 января 1892 — 7 августа 1957) — аме&shy;риканский комедийный актёр, став&shy;ший извест&shy;ным благо&shy;даря комическому дуэту Лорел и Харди, в котором он выступал более 30 лет.</p>\r\n<p><b>Юные годы</b><br>\r\nНорвел Харди появился на све­­­т 18 января 1892 года в небольшом городе Гарлем в штате Джорджия. Его отец, Оливер Харви, был ветераном Гражданской войны в США, участником сражения при Энтитеме, а мать, Эмили Норвел, была представительницей старейшей семьи в штате, а среди её предков был капитан Хью Норвел, участвовавший ещё в колониальных войнах в XVIII веке. Норвел был самым младшим из пяти детей в семье, а менее чем через год после его рождения, глава семейства умер.\r\nСмерть отца всё же не оставила семью без средств к существованию, так как их мать была успешной владелицей отеля. Будучи ещё мальчишкой, Норвел был отправлен в военную академию в соседний город Милледжвилль, где пробыл до 13 лет. В 1905 году он поступил в методистский колледж в город Янг-Харрис на севере Джорджии, где получил среднее образование. Интереса к получению знаний он не испытывал, зато с юных лет увлекался музыкой и театром. Его мать поддерживала увлечения сына и отправила его в школу-интернат в Атланту, чтобы изучать пение и музыку. Но Норвел часто пропускал занятие и в итоге сбежал из школы и присоединился к странствующей театральной группе. Где-то в 1910 году, в знак уважения к отцу, Норвел прибавил к своему имени имя Оливер, став именоваться Оливер Норвел Харви, а впоследствии и вовсе стал использовать имя отца как собственное.\r\nПосле недолгого участия в театральной группе Оливер вернулся в Милледжвилль, где устроился на работу в недавно открывшийся кинотеатр, в котором совмещал обязанности киномеханика, билетёра, менеджера и дворника. Вскоре он стал одержим киноиндустрией и решил, что может намного лучше сыграть в кино, чем это ­­­делают увиденные им актёры. По совету друга в 1913 году он переехал в город Джэксонвилл в штат Флорида, где стал в ночное время петь в водевилях в кабаре и ночных клубах, а днём проводил время на местной киностудии «Lubin Studios». Там он познакомился с пианисткой Маделин Салошин, которая в 1913 году стала его первой супругой.</p>\r\n<p><b>Начало кинокарьеры</b><br>\r\nЕго кинодебют состоялся год спустя на этой же студии в комедийном немом фильме «Перехитрить папу», где он значился под именем О. Н. Харди. Только в 1914 году Харди появился почти что в 40 кинокартинах. Из-за своего высокого роста и большого веса ему доставался лишь ограниченный круг ролей. Наиболее часто он играл толстяков или злодеев в комедийных фильмах, где его крупные габариты лишь дополняли его образы. После не менее плодотворного 1915 года Харди переехал в Нью-Йорк, где стал сниматься на киностудиях «Pathé», «Casino» и «Edison Studios».\r\nПо возвращении в Джэксонвилл Харди уже не вернулся на «Lubin», а стал сотрудничать со студиями «Vim» и «King Bee studios». Там он часто снимался вместе с Чарли Чаплином, при этом во многом подражая комику Эрику Кэмпбеллу, с которым Чаплин сотрудничал годом ранее. После переезда в Лос-Анджелес в 1917 году Оливер Харди стал работать сразу на нескольких независимых голливудских студиях. В том же году он снялся в комедии Брончо Билли Андерсона «Пёс-талисман», где его коллегой по экрану впервые стал Стэн Лорел. Всё же их знаменитый дуэт образовался позже, а после 1917 они не снимались вместе несколько лет.\r\nС 1918 по 1923 год Харди работал на киностудии «Vitagraph», где также играл комедийные роли толстяков в компании с актёром Ларри Симонном. В 1919 году он разошёлся со своей женой, а в 1920 году был оформлен официальный развод, якобы из-за неверности Харди. Уже через год он вновь связал себя узами брака с актрисой Миртл Ривз.</p>\r\n<p><b>Лорел и Харди</b><br>\r\nВ 1925 году он вновь встретился со Стэном Лорелом на киностудии «Hal Roach Studios», где тот был режиссёром фильма «Да, да, Нанетт!», и где Харди в свою очередь исполнил одну из ролей. Их тесное сотрудничество началось в 1927 году со съёмок в фильмах «Утиный суп» и «Скользкие жёны». Режиссёр студии «Hal Roach Studios» Лео МакКэри заметил большой интерес аудитории к совместным работам Харди и Лорела и в дальнейшем стал умышленно снимать их вместе, что в итоге к концу того же года привело к появлению дуэта под названием Лорел и Харди, ставшего, возможно, одним из самых известных комических дуэтов в истории кино.\r\nВслед за этим последовало множество новых совместных комедий, среди которых «Рано в кровать» (1928), «Доходное дело» (1929), «Идеальный день» (1929), «Ещё одна хорошая путаница» (1930), «Будь больше!» (1931), «Украденные драгоценности» (1931) и множество других кинокомедий. Их первая комедия, снятая в цвете, вышла на экраны в 1930 году и называлась «Песня мошенника», а год спустя они впервые появились в полнометражном фильме «Простите нас», хотя вплоть до 1935 года продолжали появляться и в короткометражках. Их наивысшим достижением стала комедия «Музыкальная шкатулка», которая в 1932 году принесла Лорелу и Харди премию «Оскар» в новой номинации «Лучший короткометражный комедийный фильм».</p>\r\n<p><b>Лорел и Харди в программе «USO»</b><br>\r\nНесмотря на такой творческий успех, в личной жизни Оливера Харди было не всё гладко. Его жена Миртл Ривз стала жертвой алкоголизма, из-за чего в 1937 году их пара распалась. После перезаключения контракта с Холом Роучем Лорел и Харди оказались на студии «General Services Studio», где в 1939 году появились вместе в успешной комедии «Летающая парочка». На съёмках этой картины Оливер Харди познакомился со сценаристкой Вирджинией Люсиль Джонс, которая год спустя стала его супругой, и они прожили в счастливом браке 17 лет.\r\nСо вступлением США во Вторую мировую войну в декабре 1941 года в стране появляется организация «USO», которая стала заниматься организацией развлекательных программ и концертов для военнослужащих союзных войск. Основными артистами там были знаменитые американские звёзды, в том числе и Лорел с Харди. Они выступали перед солдатами с различными комическими номерами, в большинстве своём в Великобритании.</p>\r\n<p><b>Спад популярности</b><br>\r\nВ то же время они окончательно покинули студию Хола Роуча и стали сниматься на таких крупных кинокомпаниях, как «20th Century Fox» и «MGM». Несмотря на больший коммерческий успех этих фильмов, их художественная особенность оставляла желать лучшего, что в итоге привело к спаду их популярности. К концу 1940-х годов они почти совсем перестали появляться на большом экране, а в 1947 году отправились в гастрольный шестинедельный тур по Великобритании. Из-за большого успеха, который сопровождал их во время всех выступлений, их тур растянулся на несколько лет, включив в себя страны Скандинавии, Бельгию и Францию, а затем вновь Великобританию.</p>\r\n<p><b>Лорел и Харди в фильме «Утопия»</b><br>\r\nВ 1949 году друг Оливера Харди, также знаменитый актёр Джон Уэйн, убедил его вернуться на большой экран, пригласив его в фильм «Боец из Кентукки», где он сам играл главную роль. Год спустя, уже по настоянию Фрэнка Капры, Оливер Харди снялся в небольшой роли в его фильме «Стремясь высоко» с Бингом Кросби в главной роли. В 1951 году Лорел и Харди в последний раз появились вместе на большом экране в совместной французско-итальянской комедии «Атолл К» (в американском прокате — «Утопия»), которая по многим пунктам уступала их прежним совместным проектам и не принесла им большого успеха. В 1955 году они заключили контракт с Холом Роучем-мл. на съёмки телевизионного комедийного шоу, но из-за инсульта Лорела, после которого он долго не мог оправиться, и проблем со здоровьем самого Харди этот проект так и не был реализован.</p>\r\n<p><b>Последние годы</b><br>\r\nПосле сердечного приступа, который Оливер Харди перенёс в мае 1954 года, он стал предельно чётко следить за своим здоровьем. За последующие пару месяцев он сбросил почти 70 кг веса, став при этом совершенно другим человеком, в котором тяжело было узнать прежнего толстяка Оливера Харди. В своих письмах к Лорелу он сообщал ему о том, что возможно болен раком, что, скорее всего и стало причиной большой потери веса.\r\nВ сентябре того же года у Харди случился инсульт, в результате которого он в течение нескольких месяцев не мог разговаривать. Всё это время рядом с ним была его жена Вирджиния, которая постоянно о нём заботилась. В начале августа 1957 года актёр перенёс ещё два инсульта, после чего впал в кому, из которой так и не вышел. Оливер Харди скончался 7 августа 1957 года в возрасте 65 лет.Он был похоронен на мемориальном кладбище в Северном Голливуде. Его вклад в кинематограф был отмечен звездой на Голливудской аллее славы.</p>\r\n<p><b>Интересные факты</b><br>\r\nОливер Харди снялся более чем в 400 фильмах.\r\nЕго любимым занятием была игра в гольф, которой он научился у Ларри Симона.\r\nПосле его смерти Стэн Лорел дал клятву больше никогда не сниматься, которую, несмотря на многочисленные предложения режиссёров, выполнил.\r\nЛорел и Харди были включены журналом «Entertainment Weekly» в список 45 величайших кинозвёзд всех времён.\r\nВ честь Оливера Харди назван астероид (2866) Харди.\r\nПерсонаж Оливера Харди в исполнении Джона Фокса появляется в биографическом фильме «Хэрлоу» в 1965 году.\r\nВ 1967 году Харди был изображён на обложке альбома The Beatles «Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band».\r\nВ Италии Оливера Харди озвучивал знаменитый комик Альберто Сорди.\r\nБен Кортман, вампир из романа Ричарда Матесона «Я — Легенда», по мнению главного героя романа Роберта Невилля, был двойником Оливера Харди.\r\nОливер Харди был масоном, членом ложи «Соломон» № 20 в Джексонвиле, во Флориде.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<p><b>Oliver Hardy</b><br>\r\nOliver Norvell “Babe” Hardy (born Norvell Hardy; January 18, 1892 – August 7, 1957) was an American comic actor famous as one half of Laurel and Hardy, the classic double act that began in the era of silent films and lasted 25 years, from 1927 to 1951. He appeared with his comedy partner Stan Laurel in 107 short films, feature films, and cameo roles. He was credited with his first film, Outwitting Dad, in 1914. In some of his early works, he was billed as “Babe Hardy”, using his nickname.</p>\r\n<p><b>Early life and education</b><br>\r\nOliver Hardy was born Norvell Hardy in Harlem, Georgia. His father Oliver was a Confederate veteran who had been wounded at the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862. After his demobilization as a recruiting officer for Company K, 16th Georgia Regiment, the elder Oliver Hardy assisted his father in running the vestiges of the family cotton plantation. He bought a share in a retail business and was elected full-time Tax Collector for Columbia County, Georgia. Norvell’s mother Emily Norvell was the daughter of Thomas Benjamin Norvell and Mary Freeman, descended from Captain Hugh Norvell of Williamsburg, Virginia, who had arrived in Virginia before 1635. Hardy and Norvell had married March 12, 1890; it was the second marriage for the widow Emily, and the third for Oliver. He was of paternal English American descent and maternal Scottish American descent.\r\nThe family moved to Madison in 1891, before Norvell’s birth. Emily Hardy owned a house in Harlem, which was either empty or rented out to tenant farmers. Norvell was likely born in Harlem, though some sources say that his birth occurred in Covington, his mother’s home town. His father died less than a year after his birth. Hardy was the youngest of five children. His older brother Sam Hardy died in a drowning accident in the Oconee River. Hardy pulled his brother from the river but was unable to resuscitate him.\r\nAs a child, Hardy was sometimes difficult. He was sent to Georgia Military College in Milledgeville as a youngster. He was sent to Young Harris College in north Georgia in the 1905-1906 school year fall semester (September–January) when he was 13. He was in the junior high component of that institution of the time (the equivalent of high school today).\r\nHardy had little interest in formal education, although he acquired an early interest in music and theater, possibly from his mother’s tenants. He joined a theatrical group, and later ran away from a boarding school near Atlanta to sing with the group. His mother recognized his talent for singing and sent him to Atlanta to study music and voice with singing teacher Adolf Dahm-Petersen. Hardy skipped some of his lessons to sing in the Alcazar Theater, a cinema, for US$3.50 a week. He subsequently decided to go back to Milledgeville.\r\nSometime prior to 1910, Hardy began styling himself «Oliver Norvell Hardy», adding the first name «Oliver» as a tribute to his father. He appeared as «Oliver N. Hardy» in the 1910 U.S. census,[N 1] and he used «Oliver» as his first name in all subsequent legal records, marriage announcements, etc.\r\n\r\nHardy was initiated into Freemasonry at Solomon Lodge No. 20 in Jacksonville, Florida. His membership is mentioned in the TV interview on an episode of This Is Your Life in 1954. Hardy’s mother wanted him to attend the University of Georgia in the fall of 1912 to study law, but there is no evidence that he did.\r\nCareer</p>\r\n<p><b>Advertisement with Hardy for A Day at School (1916), part of the Plump & Runt series</b><br>\r\nIn 1910, when a movie theater opened in Hardy’s home town of Milledgeville, he became the projectionist, ticket taker, janitor and manager. He soon became obsessed with the new motion picture industry, and was convinced that he could do a better job than the actors he saw. A friend suggested that he move to Jacksonville, Florida, where some films were being made. In 1913, Hardy did that, working in Jacksonville as a cabaret and vaudeville singer at night, and at the Lubin Manufacturing Company during the day. It was at this time that he met Madelyn Saloshin, a pianist, whom he married on November 17, 1913 in Macon, Georgia.\r\nThe next year he made his first movie, Outwitting Dad (1914), for the Lubin studio. He was billed as O. N. Hardy. In his personal life, he was known as «Babe» Hardy, a nickname that he was given by an Italian barber, who would apply talcum powder to Oliver’s cheeks and say, «nice-a-bab-y.» In many of his later films at Lubin, he was billed as «Babe Hardy.» Hardy was a big man at 6’1» tall and weighing up to 300 pounds. His size placed limitations on the roles he could play. He was most often cast as «the heavy» or the villain. He also frequently had roles in comedy shorts, his size complementing the character.\r\nBy 1915, Hardy had made 50 short one-reeler films at Lubin. He later moved to New York and made films for the Pathé, Casino and Edison Studios. After returning to Jacksonville, he made films for the Vim Comedy Company. That studio closed after Hardy discovered the owners were stealing from the payroll.[4] He worked for the King Bee studio, which bought Vim. He worked with Bill Ruge, Billy West (a Charlie Chaplin imitator), and comedic actress Ethel Burton Palmer during this time. (Hardy continued playing the «heavy» for West well into the early 1920s, often imitating Eric Campbell to West’s Chaplin.)\r\nWith Stan Laurel in The Lucky Dog (1921), long before they became a team.\r\nIn 1917 Hardy moved to Los Angeles, working freelance for several Hollywood studios. Between 1918 and 1923, Hardy made more than 40 films for Vitagraph, mostly playing the «heavy» for Larry Semon. In 1919, he separated from his wife, ending with a provisional divorce in November 1920, which was finalized on November 17, 1921. On November 24, 1921, Hardy married again, to actress Myrtle Reeves. This marriage was also unhappy. Reeves was said to have become alcoholic.\r\nIn 1921, he appeared in the movie The Lucky Dog, produced by G.M. («Broncho Billy») Anderson and starring a young British comedian named Stan Laurel.[5] Oliver Hardy played the part of a robber, trying to stick up Stan’s character. They did not work together again for several years. In 1924, Hardy began working at Hal Roach Studios with the Our Gang films and Charley Chase. In 1925, he starred as the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz. Also that year he was in the film, Yes, Yes, Nanette!, starring Jimmy Finlayson and directed by Stan Laurel. (In later years Finlayson frequently was a supporting actor in the Laurel and Hardy film series.) He also continued playing supporting roles in films featuring Clyde Cooke and Bobby Ray.\r\n\r\nIn 1926, Hardy was scheduled to appear in Get ‘Em Young. He was unexpectedly hospitalized after being burned by a hot leg of lamb. Laurel, who had been working as a gag man and director at Roach Studios, was recruited to fill in.  Laurel continued to act and, later that year, appeared in the same movie as Hardy, 45 Minutes from Hollywood, although they did not share any scenes together.\r\nMovie poster of Another Fine Mess (1930)\r\nIn 1927, Laurel and Hardy began sharing screen time together in Slipping Wives, Duck Soup (no relation to the 1933 Marx Brothers’ film of the same name) and With Love and Hisses. Roach Studios’ supervising director Leo McCarey, realizing the audience reaction to the two, began intentionally teaming them together. This led to the start of a Laurel and Hardy series later that year.\r\nThey began producing a huge body of short movies, including The Battle of the Century (1927) (with one of the largest pie fights ever filmed), Should Married Men Go Home? (1928), Two Tars (1928), Unaccustomed As We Are (1929, marking their transition to talking pictures) Berth Marks (1929), Blotto (1930), Brats (1930) (with Stan and Ollie portraying themselves, as well as their own «sons», using oversized furniture sets for the «young» Laurel and Hardy); Another Fine Mess (1930), Be Big! (1931), and many others.\r\nIn 1929, they appeared in their first feature, in one of the revue sequences of Hollywood Revue of 1929, and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in a lavish all-color (in Technicolor) musical feature entitled The Rogue Song. This film marked their first appearance in color, yet only a few fragments of this film survive. In 1931, they starred in their first full-length movie, Pardon Us; they continued to make features and shorts until 1935. The Music Box, a 1932 short, won them an Academy Award for best short film — their only such award.\r\nLaurel and Hardy in The Flying Deuces (1939)\r\nIn 1936, Hardy and Myrtle Reeves divorced. In 1939, while waiting for a contractual issue between Laurel and Hal Roach to be resolved, Hardy made Zenobia with Harry Langdon. Eventually, however, new contracts were agreed upon and the team was loaned out to producer Boris Morros at General Service Studios to make The Flying Deuces (1939). While on the lot, Hardy fell in love with Virginia Lucille Jones, a script girl, whom he married the next year. They enjoyed a happy marriage until his death.\r\nIn 1939, Laurel and Hardy made A Chump at Oxford (1940) (which features a moment of role reversal, with Oliver becoming a subordinate to a temporarily concussed Stan) and Saps at Sea (1940) before leaving Roach Studios. They began performing for the USO, supporting the Allied troops during World War II. They teamed up to make films for 20th Century Fox and later Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Although they made more money at the bigger studios, they had very little artistic control; critics say that these films lack the very qualities that had made Laurel and Hardy worldwide names. Their last Fox feature was The Bullfighters (1945), after which they declined to extend their contract with the studio.\r\nIn 1947, Laurel and Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom. Initially unsure of how they would be received, they were mobbed wherever they went. The tour was lengthened to include engagements in Scandinavia, Belgium, France, as well as a Royal Command Performance for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Biographer John McCabe said they continued to make live appearances in the United Kingdom and France for the next several years, until 1954, often using new sketches and material that Laurel had written for them.</p>\r\n<p><b>Oliver Hardy in The Fighting Kentuckian (1949)</b><br>\r\nIn 1949, Hardy’s friend, John Wayne, asked him to play a supporting role in The Fighting Kentuckian. Hardy had previously worked with Wayne and John Ford in a charity production of the play What Price Glory? while Laurel began treatment for his diabetes a few years previously. Initially hesitant, Hardy accepted the role at the insistence of his comedy partner. Frank Capra later invited Hardy to play a cameo role in Riding High with Bing Crosby in 1950.\r\nDuring 1950–51, Laurel and Hardy made their final film. Atoll K (also known as Utopia) was a simple concept; Laurel inherits an island, and the boys set out to sea, where they encounter a storm and discover a brand new island, rich in uranium, making them powerful and wealthy. However, the film was produced by a consortium of European interests, with an international cast and crew that could not speak to each other.[8] In addition, the script needed to be rewritten by Laurel to make it fit the comedy team’s style, and both suffered serious physical illness during the filming.\r\nOliver Hardy, along with Stan Laurel, made two live television appearances: In 1953, on a live BBC television broadcast of the popular show «Face the Music» with host Henry Hall and in December 1954, on NBC’s This Is Your Life. They also appeared in a filmed insert for the BBC-TV show This Is Music Hall in 1955, their final public appearance together.\r\nParty due to the overwhelmingly positive response to the This Is Your Life telecast, the pair contracted with Hal Roach, Jr., to produce a series of TV shows based on the Mother Goose fables in 1955. According to biographer John McCabe, they were to be filmed in color for NBC, but the series was postponed when Laurel suffered a stroke and required a lengthy convalescence. Later that year while Laurel was recovering, Hardy had a heart attack and stroke from which he never physically recovered.</p>\r\n<p><b>Death</b><br>\r\nGrave of Oliver Hardy, at Valhalla Memorial Park\r\nIn May 1954, Hardy suffered a mild heart attack. During 1956, he began looking after his health for the first time in his life. He lost more than 150 pounds in a few months, which completely changed his appearance. Letters written by Laurel refer to Hardy having terminal cancer. Some readers have thought this was the real reason for Hardy’s rapid weight loss. Both men were heavy smokers. Hal Roach said they were a couple of «freight train smoke stacks».\r\nHardy suffered a major stroke on September 14, 1956, which left him confined to bed and unable to speak for several months. He remained at home, in the care of his beloved Lucille. He suffered two more strokes in early August 1957, and slipped into a coma from which he never recovered. Hardy died from cerebral thrombosis on August 7, 1957, at the age of 65. [N 2] His cremated remains are located in the Masonic Garden of Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood. Stan Laurel was too ill to attend the funeral of his friend and film partner,[13] stating, «Babe would understand.»</p>\r\n<p><b>Legacy</b><br>\r\nStatue of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy outside the Coronation Hall Theatre, Ulverston, Cumbria, England\r\nHardy’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located at 1500 Vine Street, Hollywood, California.\r\nIn 1999, merchandiser Larry Harmon produced the direct-to-video film The All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy: For Love or Mummy, starring Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain as the comedy duo.\r\nThere is a small Laurel and Hardy Museum in Hardy’s hometown of Harlem, Georgia, which opened on July 15, 2000. Every year, the first Saturday in October, Oliver Hardy is celebrated and remembered with the Oliver Hardy Festival in this town.\r\nAn upcoming film, Stan & Ollie, will see Hardy played by American actor John C. Reilly, and Laurel played by English comedian Steve Coogan. Developed by BBC Films, the film is set in the twilight of their careers, and will focus on their farewell tour of Britain’s variety halls in 1953.</p> \r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import Heroes from '../../heroes.js'\r\n\r\n    export default { data() { \r\n        return { names: Heroes.filter(h => h.id === 'hardy')[0].names } \r\n    } }\r\n</script>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Hardy.vue?1ac9fcc1","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n\r\n    $heroes: hardy weixler warner pickford falconetti aoki stonehouse shipman normand;\r\n    @each $hero in $heroes {\r\n        .hero--#{$hero} {\r\n            background-image: url(../../assets/images/heroes/#{$hero}.png);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .heroes {\r\n        margin-top: $wrapper-offset;\r\n\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n        justify-content: center;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .hero {\r\n        position: relative;\r\n        background-size: 100% 100%;\r\n        width: #{$page-width / 3};\r\n        height: 150px;\r\n\r\n        &__cover {\r\n            @extend .abs-full;\r\n\r\n            background: $color-white;\r\n            opacity: 0;\r\n            transition: all 500ms ease;\r\n\r\n            &:hover {\r\n                opacity: 1;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            $border-width: 10px;\r\n            &::after {\r\n                @extend .abs-full;\r\n                content: '';\r\n                border: $border-width solid $color-blue;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            &[data-x='0']::after {\r\n                left: -$border-width;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            &[data-y='0']::after {\r\n                top: -$border-width;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            &[data-x='2']::after {\r\n                right: -$border-width;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            &[data-y='2']::after {\r\n                bottom: -$border-width;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            display: flex;\r\n            justify-content: center;\r\n            align-items: center;\r\n            \r\n            > div {\r\n                text-align: center;\r\n                \r\n                > span {\r\n                    @extend .fheader;\r\n\r\n                    &:first-of-type {\r\n                        color: $color-black;\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                    &:last-of-type {\r\n                        color: $color-blue;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div class=\"heroes\">\r\n        <div v-for=\"(hero, index) in heroes\"\r\n                :class=\"'hero hero--' + hero.id\">\r\n            <router-link :to=\"'/people/' +  hero.id\">\r\n                <div class=\"hero__cover\" :data-x=\"index % 3\" :data-y=\"Math.floor(index / 3)\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <span>{{ hero.names[0] }}\\</span><br>\r\n                        <span>\\{{ hero.names[1] }}</span>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </router-link>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import Heroes from '../../heroes.js'\r\n\r\n    export default {\r\n        data() {\r\n            return {\r\n                heroes: Heroes,\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</script>\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Index.vue?0739afaa","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class=\"title\">\r\n            <div>{{ names[0] }}\\</div>\r\n            <div>\\{{ names[1] }}</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"paper paper--person\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/heroes/normand.png\">\r\n<p><b>Мэйбл Норманд</b> (англ. Mabel Normand, 9 ноября 1892 — 23 февраля 1930) — американская комедийная актриса немого кино, а также сценарист, продюсер и режиссёр. Мэйбл достигла большой популярности на студии Мака Саннета «Keystone Studios», а на пике своей карьеры в конце 1910-х и начале 1920-х годов она также была владелицей собственной киностудии.\r\nВ 1920-х годах её имя фигурировало в деле об убийстве актёра Уильяма Дезмонда Тейлора. Этот скандал, а также заболевание актрисы туберкулёзом способствовали закату её кинокарьеры в конце 1920-х годов.</p>\r\n<p><b>Биография</b><br>\r\nМэйбл Этельрейд Норманд родилась 9 ноября 1892 года в деревне Нью-Брайтон на острове Статен-Айленд, которая теперь является районом Нью-Йорка. Её отец Клод Норманд работал плотником в порту, и поэтому её детство прошло в крайней бедности. В подростковом возрасте Мэйбл зарабатывала деньги, позируя в качестве модели для открыток графика Чарльза Дана Гибсона. В 1910 году, в возрасте 17 лет, она дебютировала в одном из немых фильмов на студии Д. У. Гриффита «Biograph Company».\r\nНа студии Норманд познакомилась с начинающим актёром Маком Саннетом, а после того, как он в 1912 году открыл собственную киностудию «Keystone Studios», Мэйбл стала одной из главных её звёзд Там она ярко продемонстрировала свой комедийный талант и быстро завоевала любовь у публики. На экранах Мэйбл Норманд часто появлялась с такими комедийными мэтрами, как Гарольд Ллойд, Чарли Чаплин и Роско Арбакл.\r\nВ 1914 году, на пике своей карьеры, Мэйбл Норманд снялась в таких знаменитых немых фильмах, как «Необыкновенно затруднительное положение Мэйбл», «Настигнутый в кабаре», «Деловой день Мэйбл» и «Состоявшееся знакомство».\r\nВ 1918 году, после расставания с Саннетом, Мэйбл подписала контракт с кинопродюсером Сэмюэлем Голдуином на съёмки в кино за $3 500 в неделю, а позже открыла свою собственную киностудию в калифорнийском городе Калвер-сити.\r\nВ начале 1920-х годов Мэйбл стала близкой подругой актёра и режиссёра Уильяма Дезмонда Тейлора. 1 февраля 1922 года, спустя несколько минут после того, как Норманд покинула его дом, Тейлор был убит. Полиция много допрашивала актрису по этому делу, но всё же она никогда не была под подозрением Мэйбл хорошо досталось от газетчиков, которые даже по прошествии времени продолжали обсуждать это убийство, её связь с Тейлором, а также возможные пристрастия актрисы к наркотикам.\r\nСпустя пару лет, в 1924 году, Мэйбл Норманд опять стала главной темой для обсуждения в газетах — её шофёр Джо Келли ранил из пистолета крупного нефтяника-миллионера Кортленда С. Дайнеса, который в то время встречался с подругой Мэйбл актрисой Эдной Пёрвиэнс.\r\nНесмотря на множество сплетен и нападок в свой адрес, Мэйбл продолжала сниматься в кино, а в 1926 году подписала контракт со студией «Hal Roach Studios». В том же году Норманд вышла замуж за актёра Лью Коуди, с которым снималась вместе в фильме «Микки» в 1918 году, а также была соседкой по дому в Беверли-Хиллз. В то же время у актрисы начались проблемы со здоровьем, вызванные туберкулёзом. Из-за этого ей пришлось распрощаться с кино и много времени провести в санатории. Несмотря на усердие врачей актрису спасти не удалось, и 23 февраля 1930 года в возрасте 37 лет Мэйбл Норманд умерла.\r\nЗа свой вклад в киноиндустрию Мэйбл Норманд удостоена звезды на Голливудской аллее славы.</p>\r\n<p><b>Интересные факты</b><br>\r\nСчитается что именно Мэйбл Норманд является автором номера с запусканием кремового пирога в лицо. Впервые она осуществила это на съёмочной площадке фильма «Шум из глубины», когда пирог полетел в лицо актёра Роско Арбакла.\r\nВ фильме Билли Уайлдера 1950 года «Бульвар Сансет» главным персонажем является стареющая звезда немого кино Норма Дезмонд. Её имя является сочетанием имён Мэйбл Норманд и Уильяма Дезмонда Тейлора.\r\nВ 1992 году в фильме «Чаплин» роль Мэйбл Норманд исполнила Мариса Томей.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<p><b>Mabel Normand</b> (November 9, 1892 – February 23, 1930) was an American silent film actress, screenwriter, director, and producer. She was a popular star and collaborator of Mack Sennett in his Keystone Studios  films and, at the height of her career in the late 1910s and early 1920s, had her own movie studio and production company.  Onscreen, she appeared in 12 successful films with Charles Chaplin and 17 with Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle, sometimes writing and directing (or co-writing/directing) movies featuring Chaplin as her leading man.  Throughout the 1920s, her name was linked with widely publicized scandals, including the 1922 murder of William Desmond Taylor and the 1924 shooting of Courtland S. Dines, who was shot by Normand’s chauffeur using her pistol. She was not a suspect in either crime. Her film career declined, possibly due to both scandals and a recurrence of tuberculosis in 1923, which led to a decline in her health, retirement from films, and her death in 1930 at age 37.</p>\r\n<p><b>Early life and career height</b><br>\r\nBorn Mabel Ethelreid Normand in New Brighton, Staten Island, New York, she grew up in a working-class family. Normand’s mother was of Irish heritage, while her father was French Canadian.  Her father Claude Normand was employed as a cabinet maker and stage carpenter at Sailors’ Snug Harbor home for elderly seamen. Before she entered films at age 16 in 1909, Normand worked as an artist’s model, which included posing for postcards illustrated by Charles Dana Gibson, creator of the Gibson Girl image, as well as for Butterick’s clothing pattern manufacturers in lower Manhattan. For a short time, she worked for Vitagraph Studios in New York City for $25 per week, but Vitagraph founder Albert E. Smith admitted she was one of several actresses about whom he made a mistake in estimating their “potential for future stardom.”  Her quietly effervescent lead performance, while directed by D. W. Griffith in the dramatic 1911 short film Her Awakening, drew attention and she met director Mack Sennett while at Griffith’s Biograph Company. She embarked on a topsy-turvy relationship with him; he later brought her across to California when he founded Keystone Studios in 1912. Her earlier Keystone films portrayed her as a bathing beauty but Normand quickly demonstrated a flair for comedy and became a major star of Sennett’s short films. Normand appeared with Charles Chaplin and Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle in many short films as well as Oliver Hardy, Stan Laurel, and Boris Karloff.\r\nShe played a key role in starting Chaplin’s film career and acted as his leading lady and mentor in a string of films in 1914, sometimes co-writing and directing or co-directing films with him. Chaplin had considerable initial difficulty adjusting to the demands of film acting and his performance suffered for it. After his first film appearance in Making a Living, Sennett felt he had made a costly mistake.  Most historians agree it was Normand who persuaded him to give Chaplin another chance,  and she and Chaplin appeared together in a dozen subsequent films, almost always as a couple in the lead roles. In 1914, she starred with Marie Dressler and Chaplin in Tillie’s Punctured Romance, the first feature-length comedy. Earlier that same year, in January/February, Chaplin first played his Tramp character in Mabel’s Strange Predicament, although it wound up being the second Tramp film released; Chaplin offers an account of his experience on the film in his autobiography. \r\nShe opened her own company in partnership with Mack Sennett 1916. It was based in Culver City and was a subsidiary of the Triangle Film Corperation. She lost the company in 1918 when Triangle experienced a massive shake up which also saw Sennett lose Keystone and establish his own independent studio.\r\nIn 1918, as her relationship with Sennett came to an end, Normand signed a $3,500 per week contract with Samuel Goldwyn.</p>\r\n<p><b>Taylor’s murder</b><br>\r\nDirector William Desmond Taylor shared her interest in books, and the two formed a close relationship. According to author Robert Giroux, Taylor was deeply in love with Normand, who had originally approached him for help in curing her cocaine dependency. Based upon Normand’s subsequent statements to investigators, her repeated relapses were devastating for Taylor. According to Giroux, Taylor met with federal prosecutors shortly before his death and offered to assist them in filing charges against Normand’s cocaine suppliers. Giroux expresses a belief that Normand’s suppliers learned of this meeting and hired a contract killer to murder the director. According to Giroux, Normand suspected the reasons for Taylor’s murder, but did not know the identity of the man who killed him.According to Kevin Brownlow and John Kobal in their book Hollywood The Pioneers the idea that Taylor was murdered by drug dealers was invented by the studio for publicity purposes.  There is no evidence that Normand was an addict, despite the fact that this is often repeated as if it were established fact.\r\nOn the night of his murder, February 1, 1922, Normand left Taylor’s bungalow at 7:45 p.m. in a happy mood, carrying a book he had lent her. They blew kisses to each other as her limousine drove away. Normand was the last person known to have seen Taylor alive. The Los Angeles Police Department subjected Normand to a grueling interrogation, but ruled her out as a suspect.  Most subsequent writers have done the same. However, Normand’s career had already slowed, and her reputation was tarnished. According to George Hopkins, who sat next to her at Taylor’s funeral, Normand wept inconsolably.</p>\r\n<p><b>The Dines shooting</b><br>\r\nIn 1924, Normand’s chauffeur Joe Kelly shot and wounded millionaire oil broker and amateur golfer Courtland S. Dines with her pistol.  At the time of the shooting, Dines was romantically involved with Normand’s friend (and frequent Chaplin co-star) Edna Purviance. Purviance was also the next door neighbor of William Desmond Taylor.</p>\r\n<p><b>The Roscoe Arbuckle trials</b><br>\r\nNormand’s co-star in many films, Roscoe Arbuckle was the defendant in three widely publicized trials for the rape and manslaughter of actress Virginia Rappe. Although Arbuckle was acquitted, the scandal destroyed his career, and his films were banned from exhibition for decades. Since she had made some of her best works with him, much of Normand’s output was withheld from the public by default.</p>\r\n<p><b>Later career and death</b><br>\r\nNormand continued making films and was signed by Hal Roach Studios in 1926 after discussions with director/producer F. Richard Jones, who had directed her at Keystone. At Roach she made the films Raggedy Rose, The Nickel-Hopper, and One Hour Married (her last film), all co-written by Stan Laurel, and was directed by Leo McCarey in Should Men Walk Home?. The films were released with extensive publicity support from the Hollywood community, including her friend Mary Pickford.\r\nIn 1926, she married actor Lew Cody, with whom she had appeared in Mickey in 1918.  They lived separately in nearby houses in Beverly Hills. However, Normand’s health was in decline due to tuberculosis. After an extended stay in Pottenger Sanitorium, she died on February 23, 1930 from tuberculosis in Monrovia, California at the age of 37.  She was interred as Mabel Normand-Cody at Calvary Cemetery, Los Angeles.</p>\r\n<p><b>Legacy</b><br>\r\nMabel Normand has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to Motion Pictures at 6821 Hollywood Boulevard.\r\nHer film Mabel’s Blunder (1914) was added to the National Film Registry in December 2009. \r\nIn June 2010, the New Zealand Film Archive reported the discovery of a print of Normand’s film Won in a Closet (exhibited in New Zealand under its alternate title Won in a Cupboard), a short comedy previously believed lost. This film is a significant discovery, as Normand directed the movie and starred in the lead role, displaying her talents on both sides of the camera.</p>\r\n<p><b>Cultural references</b><br>\r\nA nod to Normand’s celebrity in early Hollywood came through the name of a leading character in the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard, “Norma Desmond”, which has been cited as a combination of the names Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor. The film also frequently mentions Normand by name. \r\nThe 1974 Broadway musical Mack & Mabel (Michael Stewart and Jerry Herman) fictionalized the romance between Normand and Mack Sennett. Normand was played by Bernadette Peters and Robert Preston portrayed Mack Sennett.\r\n“Hello Mabel” is a song by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band released in England on their second album The Doughnut in Granny’s Greenhouse (released as Urban Spaceman in the US.) in November 1968.\r\nNormand is mentioned during Series 2 Episode 1 of Downton Abbey by ambitious housemaid Ethel Parks. Daisy Mason (née Robinson), the kitchen maid, inquires what she is reading and Ethel responds, “Photoplay about Mabel Normand. She was nothing when she started, you know. Her father was a carpenter and they’d no money, and now she’s a shining film star.” \r\nSinger/songwriter Stevie Nicks wrote a song about the actress entitled “Mabel Normand”, which appears on her 2014 album, 24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault.</p>\r\n<p><b>Fictional portrayals</b><br>\r\nNormand is played by actress Marisa Tomei in the 1992 film Chaplin opposite Robert Downey, Jr. as Charles Chaplin; by Penelope Lagos in the first biopic about Normand’s life, a 35-minute dramatic short film entitled Madcap Mabel (2010); and by Morganne Picard in the motion picture Return to Babylon (2013).\r\nIn 2014, Normand was played on television by Andrea Deck in Series 2, Episode 8 of Mr Selfridge and by Kristina Thompson in the short film Mabel’s Dressing Room.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import Heroes from '../../heroes.js'\r\n\r\n    export default { data() { \r\n        return { names: Heroes.filter(h => h.id === 'normand')[0].names } \r\n    } }\r\n</script>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Normand.vue?0199f1d4","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class=\"title\">\r\n            <div>{{ names[0] }}\\</div>\r\n            <div>\\{{ names[1] }}</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"paper paper--person\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/heroes/pickford.png\">\r\n<p><b>Мэри Пикфорд</b> (англ. Mary Pickford; 8 апреля 1892 — 29 мая 1979), урождённая Глэ́дис Луи́за Смит — знаменитая кино- и театральная актриса канадского происхождения, соосновательница кинокомпании United Artists. Легенда немого кино. Обладательница премии «Оскар» (1930). Прославилась в амплуа девочек-сорванцов и бедных сироток и лишь в последние несколько лет карьеры перешла на «взрослые» роли. Снялась примерно в 250 фильмах.</p>\r\n<p><b>Биография</b><br>\r\nБудущая актриса родилась 8 апреля 1892 года в Торонто, при рождении получив имя Глэдис. Её отец Джон Чарльз Смит был сыном методистов, эмигрировавших в Канаду из Великобритании. Он был разнорабочим, много пил и умер 11 февраля 1898 года от кровоизлияния в мозг, когда служил казначеем на пароходе. Мать, Шарлотта Хеннесси, происходила из семьи ирландских католиков и зарабатывала на жизнь шитьём. У Глэдис были младшие брат и сестра — Джек и Лотти, — которые впоследствии взяли фамилию из её псевдонима и тоже стали актёрами. По решению матери, которая хотела угодить родственникам с обеих сторон, Глэдис прошла обряд крещения в двух церквях — методистской и католической. Тогда же её среднее имя было изменено на Мари.</p>\r\n<p><b>Творческая карьера</b><br>\r\nПосле смерти мужа Шарлотта, чтобы обеспечить семью, стала держать пансион. По совету одного из постояльцев она ради дополнительного заработка стала играть вместе с детьми в местном театре Princess Theatre. Таким образом 8 января 1900 года семилетняя Глэдис дебютировала на сцене в постановке «Серебряный король». На представлении присутствовали канадские солдаты, призванные в Южную Африку воевать с бурами .\r\nСемья Смитов на протяжении шести лет играла в водевилях и дешёвых мелодрамах. Осенью 1901 года они отправились в Буффало и пять лет гастролировали по Америке, работая на различные театральные компании. В 1907 году пятнадцатилетняя Глэдис добилась аудиенции у продюсера Дэвида Беласко и получила второстепенную роль в пьесе «Уоррены из Вирджинии»  с гонораром в 25 долларов в неделю. По настоянию Беласко она изменила своё достаточно тривиальное имя на псевдоним — Мэри Пикфорд  — и 3 декабря дебютировала на Бродвее. Автором пьесы был Вильям ДеМилль, брат которого Сесил Б. ДеМилль — впоследствии он стал одним из самых именитых кинорежиссёров Голливуда — тоже играл в этом спектакле.</p>\r\n<p><b>Первые годы в кино</b><br>\r\n«Уоррены из Вирджинии» сошли со сцены в октябре 1908 года, выдержав 380 показов, и Мэри осталась без работы. Она считала кинематограф менее значимым искусством, нежели театр, но тем не менее в начале 1909 года обратилась на киностудию Biograph Studios. Режиссёр Д. У. Гриффит устроил девушке пробы и, так как их результаты удовлетворили его, в тот же день снял её в короткометражке. Мэри, которая с самого начала карьеры проявляла деловую хватку, настояла на гонораре в 10 долларов в день, и Гриффит согласился (при том, что обычно платил актёрам вдвое меньшую сумму). В 1909 году он снял актрису более чем в 50 фильмах. Это было обусловлено тем фактом, что производство на заре кинематографа отнимало немного времени — фильмы, занимавшие одну бобину киноплёнки, длились не более 12 минут и зачастую снимались практически без сценария.\r\nСемнадцатилетняя Пикфорд в одном из своих первых фильмов — драме «Одинокая вилла» (1909) с хронометражем всего в 8 минут\r\nВ январе 1910 года Гриффит перевёз свою труппу из Нью-Йорка в Лос-Анджелес. Тогда многие кинокомпании проводили зиму на юге западного побережья, так как на северо-восточном светлое время суток становилось короче, и это затрудняло съёмочный процесс. Хотя основной причиной переезда была возможность не платить за грабительские патенты производителей съёмочной техники. Мэри продолжала активно работать, и, хотя в то время на Biograph Studios ещё не существовало титров с перечислением актёров, публика запомнила её, прозвав девочкой с золотыми кудряшками.\r\nВ декабре 1910 года Мэри покинула Гриффита и перешла на киностудию Томаса Х. Инса IMP Company, подписав контракт с гонораром в 175 долларов в неделю. Однако качество фильмов (всего более тридцати), снятых на IMP, разочаровало её, и актриса обратилась в суд с требованием разорвать контракт. Выиграв дело, она стала работать на Majestic Film Corp. с ещё большим гонораром в 225 долларов в неделю. Несмотря на то, что кинокомпания приняла в штат в качестве режиссёра её супруга, — актёра Оуэна Мура, за которого Пикфорд вышла в начале года, — их сотрудничество не задалось, и в 1912 году актриса вернулась к Гриффиту. К тому времени она стала широко известна. Пресса все чаще упоминала имя маленькой Мэри  и анонсировала ленты с её участием. Пикфорд завоевала любовь публики благодаря тому, что её игра отличалась интимностью исполнения: актриса выражала эмоции взглядом, а не экспрессивными жестами , и, как писали газеты, вкладывала в игру всё сердце и душу.\r\nВ январе 1913 года Пикфорд вернулась на сцену, сыграв в спектакле Беласко под названием «Хорошенький дьяволёнок» (небольшая роль в нём была отведена Лиллиан Гиш, восходящей звезде немого кино). Беласко согласился платить актрисе 250 долларов в неделю, что в 10 раз превышало её гонорар шестилетней давности. Затем продюсер Адольф Цукор предложил Пикфорд экранизировать пьесу. Она согласилась и подписала контракт с его кинокомпанией Famous Players, на этот раз покинув Гриффита окончательно. В 1914 году вышло семь полнометражных фильмов с участием Пикфорд (у Гриффита она снималась только в короткометражках), и в том числе мелодрама «Тэсс из Страны бурь». Роль дочери сквоттера стала поворотным моментом её карьеры. С тех пор кинопоказы фильмов Пикфорд стали сопровождаться такими аншлагами, что газеты советовали зрителям занимать места пораньше, дабы избежать давки .\r\nСотрудничество Пикфорд и Цукора сложилось невероятно успешно. Появившись за четыре года в двух десятках полнометражных фильмов, актриса превратилась в объект фанатичного обожания публики и настоящую кинозвезду — божественную куколку, воспеваемую поклонниками в стихах . Вслед за популярностью росли и гонорары: к 1916 году Мэри получала 2 тысячи долларов в неделю и половину прибыли от проката.\r\nВ тот же период окончательно сложилось её актёрское амплуа, в котором она задержалась на долгие годы. Миловидная внешность Пикфорд — миниатюрное сложение и нежное лицо, обрамлённое завитыми локонами — идеально подходила к типажам её героинь. Преимущественно ими были обездоленные сироты, девочки-подростки бедного происхождения, несправедливо обиженные жизнью девушки. Эти персонажи находили отклик в сердцах публики, вызывая сочувствие и расположение.</p>\r\n<p><b>На вершине славы</b><br>\r\nЗа пределами съёмочной площадки Пикфорд была не настолько беспомощна, как её героини, и отличалась незаурядными деловыми качествами. В 1916 году она основала собственную кинокомпанию Mary Pickford Company, которая несколько лет функционировала под патронажем Famous Players, и получила почти исключительные права на свои фильмы. Она могла отбирать для себя роли, выбирать по своему усмотрению режиссёров и актёров второго плана, утверждать рекламные кампании своих фильмов и высказывать мнение относительно монтажа. Эта договорённость позволила Пикфорд собрать съёмочную группу, с которой ей было комфортно работать. В частности она наняла режиссёра Маршалла Нилана и оператора Чарльза Рошера, которые были заняты соответственно на восьми и восемнадцати картинах актрисы. Сумма её гонорара поднялась до 10 тысяч долларов в неделю , плюс Пикфорд сохраняла право на половину прибыли от проката.\r\nИз года в год популярность актрисы продолжала расти. Её наиболее кассовыми картинами 1917 и 1918 годов были «Гордость клана» (на одном из сеансов произошло такое столпотворение, что зрители вышибли дверь в кинотеатр) , «Маленькая принцесса», «Звезда морей», «Ребекка с фермы Саннибрук» и «Бедная маленькая богатая девочка». Автором сценариев последних двух лент была Фрэнсис Марион — открытая Пикфорд, она впоследствии написала около полутора десятков сценариев к картинам актрисы и в 1921 году срежиссировала драму с её участием под названием «Свет любви». Героинями Мэри по-прежнему становились девочки-подростки, однако в некоторых картинах — например, в анти-военном фильме «Маленькая американка» и комедии «Вербовка Джоанны» — она играла вполне взрослых девушек.\r\nВ 1918 году актриса подписала контракт с First National, обязавшись сняться в трёх картинах с фиксированным гонораром в 675 тысяч долларов — около 10 миллионов долларов в пересчёте по современному курсу. Этими фильмами, производство которых от стадии сценария до финального монтажа она по-прежнему была вправе контролировать, стали «Длинноногий папочка», «Хулиганка» и «Сердце холмов» (вышли в прокат в 1919 году).\r\nВ начале 1919 года Пикфорд, Дуглас Фэрбенкс, Чарли Чаплин и Д. У. Гриффит, объединившись, создали собственную кинокомпанию United Artists, которая занималась исключительно прокатом фильмов. Решение основать собственную компанию-дистрибутор было обусловлено стремлением сломать бытовавшую в то время в Голливуде вертикальную схему работы — крупные студии не только контролировали производство фильмов, но и распространение, отдавая их в прокат в сети собственных кинотеатров.\r\nБудучи соучредителем United Artists и продюсером своих фильмов, Пикфорд превратилась в одну из самых влиятельных женщин, когда-либо работавших в киноиндустрии. Первоначально по условиям контракта актриса, равно как и остальные сооснователи, обязалась выпускать по пять фильмов в год. Однако вскоре от этой договоренности пришлось отказаться: производство становилось все более дорогостоящим и длительным процессом. В 1920 году вышло всего две ленты с участием Пикфорд, в 1921 году — три, а затем она окончательно снизила темп и стала выпускать по одному фильму в год.\r\nПервым фильмом Мэри по контракту с United Artists стала трагикомедия «Поллианна», снятая по роману Элеоноры Портер. Эта история о кроткой и добродетельной девочке-сироте пользовалась шумным успехом у публики и собрала в мировом прокате более миллиона долларов . Примечательно, что исключительная добросердечность Поллианны угнетала Пикфорд, которая к тому времени уже начинала уставать от светлых, но достаточно однообразных характеров своих героинь . Общество, впрочем, тогда только приветствовало назидательные сюжеты в кинематографе, а реклама «Поллианны» открыто сообщала, что героиня Пикфорд научит любого, как озарить светом свою жизнь и жизни других .\r\nДалее, после трагикомедии «Мыльная пена», где Мэри сыграла мечтательную прачку-замарашку, последовали драма «Свет любви», комедия «С чёрного хода» и экранизация повести Фрэнсис Барнетт «Маленький лорд Фаунтлерой». Последнему фильму (его вторым режиссёром был брат актрисы Джек Пикфорд) сопутствовали большие сборы в прокате , более того — картина добралась и до послереволюционной России, где была выпущена под названием «Два претендента». В «Маленьком лорде Фаунтлерое» Пикфорд исполнила сразу две роли — юного наследника Седрика Эррола и его матери.\r\nВ 1922 году актриса снялась в ремейке собственного хита восьмилетней давности, мелодраме «Тэсс из Страны бурь». Далее она решила рискнуть и реализовать своё давнее желание вырваться из детского амплуа — Пикфорд достигла тридцатилетнего возраста и устала играть викторианских девочек-подростков, кроме того, этот образ постепенно начал выходить из моды . В 1923 году она пригласила к сотрудничеству немецкого режиссёра Эрнста Любича и снялась в его первом американском фильме, мелодраме «Розита». Её героиня, уличная певица Розита, испытавшая на себе бремя любви короля Испании, представляла собой по-настоящему взрослую женщину, но, к сожалению — несмотря на роскошные декорации и прекрасную прессу, которая провозгласила картину очередным триумфом актрисы , — фильм пользовался меньшим успехом, нежели её предыдущие работы.\r\nПоняв, что публика отказывается воспринимать её во взрослом облике, Пикфорд вернулась к былому амплуа. В выпущенном в 1924 году историческом фильме «Дороти Вернон из Хэддон-Холла» она сыграла молодую девушку, в трагикомедии «Маленькая Анни Руни» (1925) — двенадцатилетнюю девочку-сорванца, в драме «Воробушки» (1926) — сироту-подростка. Но тем не менее в следующем 1927 году актрисе исполнилось 35 лет, и она сыграла взрослую роль в мелодраме «Моя любимая девушка».\r\nВ марте 1928 года от рака груди умерла мать Пикфорд, и актриса тяжело переживала её смерть. В том же году она решила окончательно порвать с детским имиджем и остригла свои прославленные золотые локоны. При этом событии присутствовали журналисты, и фотографии Пикфорд из парикмахерского салона попали на первые полосы газет.</p>\r\n<p><b>Закат карьеры</b><br>\r\nВ 1929 году в свои права начинала вступать эпоха звукового кино, и Пикфорд, разумеется, не могла игнорировать этот факт. Она приобрела права на экранизацию пьесы 1927 года под названием «Кокетка» — это была трагическая история о красавице Норме Безант и её возлюбленном, которого застрелил её отец. Оператором фильма должен был стать давний друг актрисы Чарльз Рошер, однако Пикфорд уволила его, когда тот прервал на середине её сцену. Рошер решил вмешаться в процесс по причине того, что на лицо актрисы легла тень, но тем не менее Пикфорд назначила оператором другого человека . Публика в конечном итоге с восторгом приняла «Кокетку» , а Пикфорд получила за роль Нормы своего первого и единственного «Оскара». Критики, однако, отнеслись к фильму более прохладно .\r\nВ 1929 году Пикфорд выпустила ещё один фильм — комедию «Укрощение строптивой» по одноимённому произведению Шекспира, где появилась в паре со своим вторым мужем Дугласом Фэрбенксом. Затем в 1930 году начала производство картины «Твоя навечно», однако из-за пристрастия к алкоголю режиссёра Маршалла Нилана заморозила проект и уничтожила отснятые материалы. Следующая картина Пикфорд, мюзикл «Кики» по мотивам пьесы Беласко, вышла в 1931 году и провалилась в прокате, возместив только половину затраченного бюджета.\r\nЕё следующая картина — вестерн 1933 года «Секреты» — тоже не имела кассового успеха. Поэтому Пикфорд решила закончить карьеру и с тех пор более не снималась.</p>\r\n<p><b>Общественная и деловая деятельность</b><br>\r\nБлагодаря безграничному доверию, которым Пикфорд пользовалась у публики, она неоднократно принимала участие в различных благотворительных акциях. В 1918 году, когда шла Первая мировая война, актриса совместно с Дугласом Фэрбенксом, Чарли Чаплином и Мэри Дресслер  посетила с публичными выступлениями несколько городов, призывая граждан покупать облигации военного займа — доход от них шёл на финансирование военных нужд.\r\nКогда Пикфорд выступала на Wall Street, её аудитория составила около 50 тысяч человек — несмотря на своё канадское происхождение, она превратилась в один из главных символов Америки тех лет, и благодаря её усилиям в поддержку армии была собрана значительная сумма. Кроме того, совместно с Монти Блю и Джоан Марш она выпустила агитационную короткометражку «Стопроцентные американцы». В то время Пикфорд была очень популярна в армии: в её честь были названы две пушки, 143-й артиллерийский полк носил неофициальное название «Барашки Мэри» , а сама она в феврале 1918 года была возведена в ранг почётного полковника и присутствовала на военных парадах .\r\nВ 1921 году Пикфорд совместно с Фэрбенксом, Чаплином и Гриффитом организовала Фонд помощи нуждающимся киноактёрам (функционирует до сих пор) и стала его вице-президентом. Чтобы собрать средства, устроителями проводились благотворительные балы и киносеансы, спортивные мероприятия, показы мод и др. В 1932 году по инициативе Пикфорд фонд обратился к деятелям киноиндустрии, заработок которых превышал 200 долларов в неделю, с просьбой перечислять полпроцента или один процент от своего гонорара в пользу их менее удачливых коллег. \r\nВ 1927 году Пикфорд была в составе влиятельных голливудских лиц, основавших Американскую академию киноискусства. Её соучредителями являлись актёры Дуглас Фэрбенкс и Гарольд Ллойд, режиссёры Фред Нибло и Рауль Уолш, продюсеры Джек Уорнер и Ирвинг Тальберг, а также другие деятели, составлявшие цвет американского кинематографа тех лет.\r\nЗатем в 1941 году, уже перестав сниматься в кино, Пикфорд предприняла вторую попытку ослабить влияние крупных студий (в то время монополия на производство и прокат фильмов почти целиком принадлежала MGM, Paramount Pictures, RKO, Warner Bros. и 20th Century Fox) и совместно с Уолтом Диснеем, Орсоном Уэллсом, Чарли Чаплином и другими основала Объединение независимых кинопродюсеров (функционировало до 1958 года).\r\nВ 1944 году Мэри стала председателем женского отделения основанного Рузвельтом Национального фонда борьбы с полиомиелитом и посещала госпитали, где лежали больные дети. В 1949 году вместе со своим третьим мужем Чарльзом Роджерсом и другом Малкольмом Бойдом она основала телерадиокомпанию Pickford-Rogers-Boyd.</p>\r\n<p><b>Личная жизнь</b><br>\r\nАктриса трижды была замужем. 7 января 1911 года восемнадцатилетняя Пикфорд вышла замуж за Оуэна Мура, актёра ирландского происхождения, в дуэте с которым часто снималась. Её мать, которая на протяжении многих лет имела большое влияние на Мэри, не разделяла симпатию дочери к Муру, поэтому некоторое время супруги скрывали от неё свои отношения. Их брак оказался неудачным из-за алкоголизма Мура и его неприятия популярности супруги. Начиная с 1914 года они жили раздельно, а затем Пикфорд завязала роман с Дугласом Фэрбенксом — в то время он выступал на Бродвее и вскоре стал столь же знаменит в кино, как и Мэри.\r\nНекоторое время они хранили свою связь в секрете от окружающих. Так как Фэрбенкс был женат, Пикфорд опасалась, что огласка приведет к скандалу, и не хотела портить свою безупречную репутацию. Однако они появлялись вместе на публике во время благотворительных туров 1918 года. 2 марта 1920 года Пикфорд наконец развелась с Муром, и в прессе начали циркулировать слухи о её возможном браке с Фэрбенксом. Несмотря на то, что актриса заявила о беспочвенности подобных слухов , 28 марта она всё-таки вышла за Фэрбенкса (актёр стал свободен ещё в ноябре 1919 года).\r\nЦеремония прошла в закрытом кругу — не были приглашены даже их близкие друзья, включая Чаплина, — а свидетелями выступили сводный брат жениха Джон Фэрбенкс и актриса Марджори Доу . 19 мая 1920 года молодожёны отплыли на пароходе Royal George в Европу и провели там всё лето . Осенью 1920 года, вскоре после того, как они вернулись в Америку, имя Пикфорд оказалось косвенно вовлечено в скандал, когда 10 сентября жена её брата Джека, актриса Олив Томас, скончалась во Франции, случайно выпив раствор сулемы (этим лекарством её супруг пытался вылечиться от хронического сифилиса).\r\nПосле медового месяца звёздная чета поселились вместе в огромном поместье Фэрбенкса неподалеку от Лос-Анджелеса, которое получило название от слияния их имен — Пикфэр. На протяжении 20-х годов Пикфорд и Фэрбенкс составляли самую известную супружескую пару Голливуда. На проводимых в их поместье приёмах собирался цвет артистического, политического и интеллектуального сообществ тех лет. В 1927 году они стали первыми актёрами, которые оставили отпечатки своих ладоней на цементной плите перед входом в кинотеатр Grauman’s Chinese Theate. Слава сопутствовала актёрам по всему миру — и в том числе в СССР.\r\nЛетом 1926 года Пикфорд и Фэрбенкс побывали в Советском Союзе, где затем была выпущена книга «Они у нас. Мери Пикфорд и Дуглас Фербенкс в СССР» . Также в 1927 году вышел фильм Сергея Комарова «Поцелуй Мэри Пикфорд». Его производство было само по себе курьёзом: документальные кадры из хроники пребывания актёров на Украине (в частности эпизод, где Мэри поцеловала одного из поклонников) были смонтированы с отснятым уже после их отъезда материалом. В итоге получилась комедия о простом парне Гоге, которому не везёт в любви, но после поцелуя звезды дамы начинают обращать на него внимание. Пикфорд узнала о существовании этого фильма только в конце жизни.\r\nОднако и этот брак актрисы в итоге распался. Из-за плотного съёмочного графика супруги проводили друг с другом немного времени. Помимо этого Фэрбенкс любил путешествовать и начиная с 1930 года уезжал в одиночку, оставляя жену дома. В начале 30-х он увлёкся британской актрисой леди Сильвией Эшли, и этот роман подвёл черту под его браком с Пикфорд. Они стали жить раздельно и развелись 10 января 1936 года. В марте 1936 года Фэрбенкс женился на Эшли. Пикфорд тоже недолго оставалась одна. 24 июня 1937 года она вышла замуж за актёра и джазового музыканта Чарльза «Бадди» Роджерса (своего партнёра в фильме 1927 года «Моя любимая девушка»), но тем не менее сохранила привязанность к Фэрбенксу и, когда в 1939 году он скончался от сердечного приступа, глубоко переживала утрату . В 1943 и 1944 годах Пикфорд и Роджерс усыновили соответственно мальчика Рональда Чарльза и девочку Роксанну. Они прожили вместе более сорока лет до самой смерти актрисы в 1979 году.</p>\r\n<p><b>Последние годы жизни и смерть</b><br>\r\nЗа Пикфорд долгое время сохранялся статус влиятельного лица в Голливуде — даже после того, как она перестала сниматься. На протяжении 1940-х годов она занималась продюсированием фильмов, выпустив, среди прочих, драму «Спи, моя любовь» (1948) с Клодет Кольбер и комедию «Счастливая любовь» (1949) с братьями Маркс. Её частная жизнь, между тем, была далека от благополучия. За несколько лет она потеряла одного за другим всех своих близких родственников. В 1928 году умерла её мать, в 1933 — брат Джек, в 1936 — сестра Лотти. Болезненное расставание с Фэрбенксом тоже способствовало развитию депрессии, и актриса пристрастилась к алкоголю.\r\nЕё приемные дети, повзрослев, рано ушли из дома. Со временем Пикфорд стала вести очень уединённую жизнь и редко покидала Пикфэр, позволяя навещать себя только Лиллиан Гиш, своему пасынку Дугласу Фэрбенксу-младшему и некоторым близким друзьям. В середине 1960-х годов она общалась с внешним миром по телефону, не выходя из спальни. В 1976 году Пикфорд наградили почётным «Оскаром» за вклад в развитие кинематографа, и съёмочная группа, направленная в Пикфэр, запечатлела короткое благодарственное выступление актрисы.\r\nНезадолго до смерти Пикфорд обратилась к правительству Канады с просьбой восстановить её гражданство, которое, как она считала, было утеряно после брака с Фэрбенксом, американским гражданином. Канада удовлетворила просьбу знаменитой соотечественницы, и таким образом на закате жизни у неё появилось двойное гражданство. Мэри Пикфорд — любимица Америки, когда-то обожаемая миллионами — скончалась от кровоизлияния в мозг 29 мая 1979 года в возрасте восьмидесяти семи лет. Она была похоронена на кладбище мемориального парка Форест-Лаун в Калифорнии на том же участке, где покоились её мать, брат и сестра.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<p><b>Gladys Louise Smith</b> (April 8, 1892 – May 29, 1979), known professionally as Mary Pickford, was a Canadian-American film actress, writer, director, and producer. She was a co-founder of the film studio United Artists and one of the original 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. \r\nKnown in her prime as “America’s Sweetheart”   and the “girl with the curls”,  Pickford was one of the Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood and a significant figure in the development of film acting. Pickford was one of the earliest stars to be billed under her name (film performers up until that time were usually unbilled), and was one of the most popular actresses of the 1910s and ‘20s, earning the nickname “Queen of the Movies”.\r\nShe was awarded the second ever Academy Award for Best Actress for her first sound film role in Coquette (1929) and also received an honorary Academy Award in 1976. In consideration of her contributions to American cinema, the American Film Institute ranked Pickford as 24th in its 1999 list of greatest female stars of classic Hollywood Cinema.</p>\r\n<p><b>Early life</b><br>\r\nMary Pickford was born Gladys Louise Smith in 1892 (although she would later claim 1893 or 1894 as her year of birth) at 211 University Avenue,A Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Her father, John Charles Smith, was the son of English Methodist immigrants, and worked a variety of odd jobs. Her mother, Charlotte Hennessey, was of Irish Catholic descent and worked for a time as a seamstress. She had two younger siblings, Charlotte, called “Lottie” (born 1893), and John Charles, called “Jack” (born 1896), who also became actors. To please her husband’s relatives, Pickford’s mother baptized her children as Methodists, the faith of their father. John Charles Smith was an alcoholic; he abandoned the family and died on February 11, 1898, from a fatal blood clot caused by a workplace accident when he was a purser with Niagara Steamship. \r\nWhen Gladys was age four, her household was under infectious quarantine, a public health measure. Their devoutly Catholic maternal grandmother (Catherine Faeley Hennessey) asked a visiting Roman Catholic priest to baptize the children. Pickford was at this time baptized as Gladys Marie Smith. \r\nCharlotte Smith began taking in boarders after being widowed. One of these was a theatrical stage manager. At his suggestion, Gladys (age 7) was given two small roles, one as a boy and the other as a girl,  in a stock company production of The Silver King at Toronto’s Princess Theatre. She subsequently acted in many melodramas with Toronto’s Valentine Company, finally playing the major child role in their version of The Silver King. She capped her short career in Toronto with the starring role of Little Eva in their production of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, adapted from the 1852 novel by American writer and abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe.</p>\r\n<p><b>Career</b><br>\r\nBy the early 1900s, theatre had become a family enterprise. Gladys, her mother and two younger siblings toured the United States by rail, performing in third-rate companies and plays. After six impoverished years, Pickford allowed one more summer to land a leading role on Broadway, planning to quit acting if she failed. In 1906 Gladys, Lottie and Jack Smith supported singer Chauncey Olcott on Broadway in Edmund Burke.  Gladys finally landed a supporting role in a 1907 Broadway play, The Warrens of Virginia. The play was written by William C. deMille, whose brother, Cecil, appeared in the cast. David Belasco, the producer of the play, insisted that Gladys Smith assume the stage name Mary Pickford.  After completing the Broadway run and touring the play, however, Pickford was again out of work.\r\nOn April 19, 1909, the Biograph Company director D. W. Griffith screen-tested her at the company’s New York studio for a role in the nickelodeon film, Pippa Passes. The role went to someone else but Griffith was immediately taken with Pickford. She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day. Most Biograph actors earned $5 a day but, after Pickford’s single day in the studio, Griffith agreed to pay her $10 a day against a guarantee of $40 a week. \r\nPickford, like all actors at Biograph, played both bit parts and leading roles, including mothers, ingenues, charwomen, spitfires, slaves, Native Americans, spurned women, and a prostitute. As Pickford said of her success at Biograph: “I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I’d become known, and there would be a demand for my work.”\r\nShe appeared in 51 films in 1909 – almost one a week. She also introduced her friend Florence La Badie to D. W. Griffith, who launched La Badie’s career. \r\nIn January 1910, Pickford traveled with a Biograph crew to Los Angeles. Many other film companies wintered on the West Coast, escaping the weak light and short days that hampered winter shooting in the East. Pickford added to her 1909 Biographs (Sweet and Twenty, They Would Elope, and To Save Her Soul, to name a few) with films made in California.\r\nActors were not listed in the credits in Griffith’s company. Audiences noticed and identified Pickford within weeks of her first film appearance. Exhibitors in turn capitalized on her popularity by advertising on sandwich boards that a film featuring “The Girl with the Golden Curls”, “Blondilocks”, or “The Biograph Girl” was inside. \r\nPickford left Biograph in December 1910. The following year, she starred in films at Carl Laemmle’s Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP). IMP was absorbed into Universal Pictures in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford returned to work with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances were in his films, such as Friends, The Mender of Nets, Just Like a Woman, and The Female of the Species. That year Pickford also introduced Dorothy and Lillian Gish (both friends from her days in touring melodrama) to Griffith.  Both became major silent stars, in comedy and tragedy, respectively. Pickford made her last Biograph picture, The New York Hat, in late 1912.\r\nShe returned to Broadway in the David Belasco production of A Good Little Devil (1912). This was a major turning point in her career. Pickford, who had always hoped to conquer the Broadway stage, discovered how deeply she missed film acting. In 1913, she decided to work exclusively in film. The previous year, Adolph Zukor had formed Famous Players in Famous Plays. It was later known as Famous Players-Lasky and then Paramount Pictures, one of the first American feature film companies.\r\nPickford left the stage to join Zukor’s roster of stars. Zukor believed film’s potential lay in recording theatrical players in replicas of their most famous stage roles and productions. Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of A Good Little Devil. The film, produced in 1913, showed the play’s Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called “one of the worst [features] I ever made ... it was deadly”.  Zukor agreed; he held the film back from distribution for a year.\r\nPickford’s work in material written for the camera by that time had attracted a strong following. Comedy-dramas, such as In the Bishop’s Carriage (1913), Caprice (1913), and especially Hearts Adrift (1914), made her irresistible to moviegoers. Hearts Adrift was so popular that Pickford asked for the first of her many publicized pay raises based on the profits and reviews.  The film marked the first time Pickford’s name was featured above the title on movie marquees.  Tess of the Storm Country was released five weeks later. Biographer Kevin Brownlow observed that the film “sent her career into orbit and made her the most popular actress in America, if not the world”. \r\nHer appeal was summed up two years later by the February 1916 issue of Photoplay as “luminous tenderness in a steel band of gutter ferocity”.  Only Charlie Chaplin, who reportedly slightly surpassed Pickford’s popularity in 1916,  had a similarly spellbinding pull with critics and the audience. Each enjoyed a level of fame far exceeding that of other actors. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Pickford was believed to be the most famous woman in the world, or, as a silent-film journalist described her, “the best known woman who has ever lived, the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history.”</p>\r\n<p><b>Stardom</b><br>\r\nPickford starred in 52 features throughout her career. On June 24, 1916, Pickford signed a new contract with Zukor that granted her full authority over production of the films in which she starred,  and a record-breaking salary of $10,000 a week.  In addition, Pickford’s compensation was half of a film’s profits, with a guarantee of $1,040,000 (US$ 17,150,000 in 2016). Occasionally, she played a child, in films such as The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917), Daddy-Long-Legs (1919) and Pollyanna (1920). Pickford’s fans were devoted to these “Little Girl” roles, but they were not typical of her career. \r\nIn August 1918, Pickford’s contract expired and, when refusing Zukor’s terms for a renewal, she was offered $250,000 to leave the motion picture business. She declined, and went to First National Pictures, which agreed to her terms.  In 1919, Pickford, along with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks, formed the independent film production company United Artists. Through United Artists, Pickford continued to produce and perform in her own movies; she could also distribute them as she chose. In 1920, Pickford’s film Pollyanna grossed around $1,100,000.  The following year, Pickford’s film Little Lord Fauntleroy was also a success, and in 1923, Rosita grossed over $1,000,000 as well.  During this period, she also made Little Annie Rooney (1925), another film in which Pickford played a child, Sparrows (1926), which blended the Dickensian with newly minted German expressionist style, and My Best Girl (1927), a romantic comedy featuring her future husband Buddy Rogers. \r\nThe arrival of sound was her undoing. Pickford underestimated the value of adding sound to movies, claiming that “adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the Venus de Milo”. \r\nShe played a reckless socialite in Coquette (1929), a role for which her famous ringlets were cut into a 1920s’ bob. Pickford had already cut her hair in the wake of her mother’s death in 1928. Fans were shocked at the transformation.  Pickford’s hair had become a symbol of female virtue, and when she cut it, the act made front-page news in The New York Times and other papers. Coquette was a success and won her an Academy Award for Best Actress,  although this was highly controversial.  The public failed to respond to her in the more sophisticated roles. Like most movie stars of the silent era, Pickford found her career fading as talkies became more popular among audiences. \r\nHer next film, The Taming of The Shrew, made with husband Douglas Fairbanks, was not well received at the box office.  Established Hollywood actors were panicked by the impending arrival of the talkies. On March 29, 1928, The Dodge Brothers Hour was broadcast from Pickford’s bungalow, featuring Fairbanks, Chaplin, Norma Talmadge, Gloria Swanson, John Barrymore, D.W. Griffith, and Dolores del Rio, among others. They spoke on the radio show to prove that they could meet the challenge of talking movies. \r\nBut the transition came as Pickford was in her late 30s, no longer able to play the children, teenage spitfires, and feisty young women so adored by her fans, and was not suited for the glamorous and vampish heroines of early sound. In 1933, Pickford underwent a Technicolor screen test for an animated/live action film version of Alice in Wonderland, but Walt Disney discarded the project when Paramount released its own version of the book. Only one Technicolor still of her screen test still exists. She retired from acting in 1933; her last acting film was released in 1934. She continued to produce for others, however, including Sleep, My Love (1948; with Claudette Colbert) and Love Happy (1949), with the Marx Brothers). </p>\r\n<p><b>The film industry</b><br>\r\nMary Pickford giving President Herbert Hoover a ticket for a film industry benefit for the unemployed, 1931\r\nPickford used her stature in the movie industry to promote a variety of causes. Although her image depicted fragility and innocence, Pickford proved to be a worthy businesswoman who took control of her career in a cutthroat industry. \r\nDuring World War I, she promoted the sale of Liberty Bonds, making an intensive series of fund-raising speeches that kicked off in Washington, D.C., where she sold bonds alongside Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Theda Bara, and Marie Dressler. Five days later she spoke on Wall Street to an estimated 50,000 people. Though Canadian-born, she was a powerful symbol of Americana, kissing the American flag for cameras and auctioning one of her world-famous curls for $15,000. In a single speech in Chicago she sold an estimated five million dollars’ worth of bonds. She was christened the U.S. Navy’s official “Little Sister”; the Army named two cannons after her and made her an honorary colonel. \r\nAt the end of World War I, Pickford conceived of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, an organization to help financially needy actors. Leftover funds from her work selling Liberty Bonds were put toward its creation, and in 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was officially incorporated, with Joseph Schenck voted its first president and Pickford its vice president. In 1932, Pickford spearheaded the “Payroll Pledge Program”, a payroll-deduction plan for studio workers who gave one half of one percent of their earnings to the MPRF. As a result, in 1940, the Fund was able to purchase land and build the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital, in Woodland Hills, California. \r\nAn astute businesswoman, Pickford became her own producer within three years of her start in features. According to her Foundation, “she oversaw every aspect of the making of her films, from hiring talent and crew to overseeing the script, the shooting, the editing, to the final release and promotion of each project.” She demanded (and received) these powers in 1916, when she was under contract to Zukor’s Famous Players In Famous Plays (later Paramount). Zukor acquiesced to her refusal to participate in block-booking, the widespread practice of forcing an exhibitor to show a bad film of the studio’s choosing to also be able to show a Pickford film. In 1916, Pickford’s films were distributed, singly, through a special distribution unit called Artcraft. The Mary Pickford Corporation was briefly Pickford’s motion-picture production company. \r\nIn 1919, she increased her power by co-founding United Artists (UA) with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her soon-to-be husband, Douglas Fairbanks. Before UA’s creation, Hollywood studios were vertically integrated, not only producing films but forming chains of theaters. Distributors (also part of the studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company’s movie venues. Filmmakers relied on the studios for bookings; in return they put up with what many considered creative interference.\r\nUnited Artists broke from this tradition. It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on Santa Monica Boulevard. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford’s acting career had largely faded.  After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, selling her remaining shares for three million dollars.</p>\r\n<p><b>Personal life</b><br>\r\nPickford was married three times. She married Owen Moore, an Irish-born silent film actor, on January 7, 1911. It is rumored she became pregnant by Moore in the early 1910s and had a miscarriage or an abortion. Some accounts suggest this resulted in her later inability to have children.  The couple had numerous marital problems, notably Moore’s alcoholism, insecurity about living in the shadow of Pickford’s fame, and bouts of domestic violence. The couple lived together on-and-off for several years. \r\nPickford became secretly involved in a relationship with Douglas Fairbanks. They toured the US together in 1918 to promote Liberty Bond sales for the World War I effort. Around this time, Pickford also suffered from the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic, but survived.  Pickford divorced Moore on March 2, 1920, after she agreed to his $100,000 demand for a settlement.  She married Fairbanks just days later on March 28, 1920. They went to Europe for their honeymoon; fans in London and in Paris caused riots trying to get to the famous couple. The couple’s triumphant return to Hollywood was witnessed by vast crowds who turned out to hail them at railway stations across the United States.\r\nThe Mark of Zorro (1920) and a series of other swashbucklers gave the popular Fairbanks a more romantic, heroic image. Pickford continued to epitomize the virtuous but fiery girl next door. Even at private parties, people instinctively stood up when Pickford entered a room; she and her husband were often referred to as “Hollywood royalty”. Their international reputations were broad. Foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visited the White House often asked if they could also visit Pickfair, the couple’s mansion in Beverly Hills. \r\nDinners at Pickfair included a number of notable guests. Charlie Chaplin, Fairbanks’ best friend, was often present. Other guests included George Bernard Shaw, Albert Einstein, Elinor Glyn, Helen Keller, H. G. Wells, Lord Mountbatten, Fritz Kreisler, Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Noël Coward, Max Reinhardt, Baron Nishi, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko,  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Austen Chamberlain, Sir Harry Lauder, and Meher Baba, among others. The public nature of Pickford’s second marriage strained it to the breaking point. Both she and Fairbanks had little time off from producing and acting in their films. They were also constantly on display as America’s unofficial ambassadors to the world, leading parades, cutting ribbons, and making speeches. When their film careers both began to flounder at the end of the silent era, Fairbanks’ restless nature prompted him to overseas travel (something which Pickford did not enjoy). When Fairbanks’ romance with Sylvia, Lady Ashley became public in the early 1930s, he and Pickford separated. They divorced January 10, 1936. Fairbanks’ son by his first wife, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., claimed his father and Pickford long regretted their inability to reconcile. \r\nOn June 24, 1937, Pickford married her third and last husband, actor and band leader Buddy Rogers. They adopted two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). As a PBS American Experience documentary noted, Pickford’s relationship with her children was tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie’s small stature and Roxanne’s crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that “Things didn’t work out that much, you know. But I’ll never forget her. I think that she was a good woman.”</p>\r\n<p><b>Later years</b><br>\r\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford became an alcoholic, as her father had been. Her mother Charlotte died of breast cancer in March 1928. Her siblings, Lottie and Jack, both died of alcohol-related causes. These deaths, her divorce from Fairbanks, and the end of silent films left Pickford deeply depressed. Her relationship with her children, Roxanne and Ronald, was turbulent at best. Pickford withdrew and gradually became a recluse, remaining almost entirely at Pickfair and allowing visits only from Lillian Gish, her stepson Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and few other people. She appeared in court in 1959, in a matter pertaining to her co-ownership of North Carolina TV station WSJS-TV. The court date coincided with the date of her 67th birthday; under oath, when asked to give her age, Pickford replied, “I’m 21, going on 20”. \r\nIn the mid-1960s, Pickford often received visitors only by telephone, speaking to them from her bedroom. Buddy Rogers often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford in the drawing room. A print of this image now hangs in the Library of Congress.  In addition to her Oscar as best actress for Coquette (1929), Mary Pickford received an Academy Honorary Award in 1976 for lifetime achievement. The Academy sent a TV crew to her house to record her short statement of thanks – offering the public a very rare glimpse into Pickfair Manor. \r\nPickford had become an American citizen upon her marriage to Fairbanks in 1920.  Toward the end of her life, Pickford made arrangements with the Department of Citizenship to regain her Canadian citizenship because she wished to “die as a Canadian”. Her request was approved and she became a dual Canadian-American citizen.</p>\r\n<p><b>Death</b><br>\r\nOn May 29, 1979, Pickford died at a Santa Monica, California hospital of complications from a cerebral hemorrhage she had suffered the week before.  She was interred in the Garden of Memory of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery in Glendale, California.  Buried alongside her in the Pickford private family plot are her mother Charlotte, her siblings Lottie and Jack Pickford, and the family of Elizabeth Watson, Charlotte’s sister, who had helped raise Pickford in Toronto.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import Heroes from '../../heroes.js'\r\n\r\n    export default { data() { \r\n        return { names: Heroes.filter(h => h.id === 'pickford')[0].names } \r\n    } }\r\n</script>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Pickford.vue?2ade2c42","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class=\"title\">\r\n            <div>{{ names[0] }}\\</div>\r\n            <div>\\{{ names[1] }}</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"paper paper--person\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/heroes/shipman.png\">\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<p><b>Nell Shipman</b> (October 25, 1892 – January 23, 1970) was a Canadian actress, author and screenwriter, producer, director, and animal trainer. She was a Canadian pioneer in early Hollywood. She is best known for her work in James Oliver Curwood stories and for portraying strong, adventurous women. In 1919, she and her producer husband, Ernest Shipman,  made the most successful silent film in Canadian history, Back to God’s Country in which she did one of the first on-screen nude scenes.</p>\r\n<p><b>Life and career</b><br>\r\nNell Shipman was born Helen Foster-Barham in Victoria, British Columbia. Her family moved to Seattle, Washington when she was 13 years old. Nell started stage acting and joined theatrical stock companies before working in film. From an early age, she developed a respect toward animals and later fought for animal rights in Hollywood speaking out against animal cruelty. She rescued as many as she could accommodate and ultimately ended up with her own zoo containing over 200 animals of all sorts.  When Nell was 18 years old, she met and married 39 year old theatrical impresario, Ernest Shipman (December 17, 1871 – August 7, 1931).\r\nAfter marrying, Ernest and Nell moved to Hollywood to start working in the film industry. During this time, Nell sold the rights of her book, Under the Crescent Moon to Universal Studios (they wanted to make a six film serial of the story). Nell also started acting in Universal, Selig & Vitagraph productions. Between 1915–1918, she played several leading roles including her big debut film God’s Country and the Woman (1915). Nell directed, produced, and acted in the film that was based on a James Oliver Curwood short story. She was one of the first directors to shoot her films almost entirely on location. \r\nIn 1918, Nell Shipman suffered from Spanish influenza and nearly died. She also lost all of her beautiful thick long hair and was forced to wear a wig. Fortunately her distinctive locks grew back.  During her recovery, she decided to create a production company called “Shipman-Curwood Producing Company”. Through the efforts of Ernest Shipman, who convinced a consortium of Calgary businessmen to invest in the potential of Alberta becoming a major film location destination, a company, Canadian Photoplays Ltd., was incorporated on February 7, 1919, with a $250,000 investment. The first and only film the company would produce was based on another Curwood story, “Wapi the Walrus” and adapted to the screen by Nell herself. The name was changed to Back to God’s Country for no other reason than to capitalize on Nell’s success in God’s Country and the Woman. \r\nThe 73-minute film (at 18 frames per second) was shot in Los Angeles, San Francisco and on location near Lesser Slave Lake, Alberta, Canada by director, David M. Hartford. The cameramen were Dal Clawson and Joseph B. Walker, who later gained fame as Hollywood director, Frank Capra’s main cinematographer.  “Back To God’s Country” was a major Canadian and international silent film hit. Nell also played the lead in the film which featured a controversial though very brief nude scene. One of the promotional advertisements for the film had a line drawing of a nude Nell from the back frolicking with several animals. Part of the caption read: “Don’t book Back To God’s Country unless you want to prove the Nude is NOT Rude.” \r\nAlthough the movie was extremely successful and brought in a 300% profit, no further investments were forthcoming. As well, Curwood was infuriated with Nell because she changed the scenario of his short story. She adapted the protagonist of the film from the Great Dane, Wapi to the female lead, Delores. Shipman also shaped her character into a heroine: she saved the male lead and in so doing created an independent character and feminist role model. \r\nAfter shooting Back to God’s Country, Nell and co-star Bert Van Tuyle, with whom she was having an affair, moved back to Hollywood where she subsequently divorced Ernest Shipman.  During this period, Nell created “Nell Shipman Productions” with Van Tuyle and established herself as an independent producer. She focused on the major themes she enjoyed: wild animals, nature, feminist heroes, and filming on location. She produced, wrote, co-directed and starred in The Girl From God’s Country (1921) and The Grub Stake (1923). Both films were successful. \r\nWhile living in Spokane, Washington, Nell Shipman made a film called The Grub Stake, which costs around $180,000 to produce. Unfortunately, the film was never distributed. The American distributor went bankrupt and during subsequent litigation, the film became tied up in the legal proceedings. During this time, Nell tried to maintain her production company and after transporting her entire zoo on barges up to Priest Lake, Idaho, she made several short films at Lion Head Lodge. Unfortunately, life was difficult as Van Tuyle became increasingly unstable and by hostile locals who killed her animals.  In a scenario reminiscent of one of her films, Nell and Bert got lost in the wild for two days during a violent snow storm in early 1924. However, they managed to escape death when they were saved by two brothers, Joseph and Fred Gumaer. \r\nLater that same year, Nell ‘s company went bankrupt and she broke up with Van Tuyle.  She was forced to send her animals to the San Diego Zoo because of her inability to pay the maintenance costs. Nell next moved across the country and traveled the world. Eventually, she started writing scripts and short stories. The most notable contribution at this time was the story which became the basis of Wings in the Dark starring Myrna Loy and Cary Grant (1934). Nell finally moved to the California desert and continued writing there for the rest of her life. For the remainder of their respective careers, neither Nell nor Ernest had been able to duplicate the success of Back to God’s Country. Ernest died at the age of 53 due to cirrhosis of the liver. Their son, Barry was an actor and a singer. He married actress, Beulah McDonald, in 1934 and went on to have a successful career as a writer for movies serials, television and feature films. \r\nNell Shipman’s Nell’s last major project was her autobiography, The Silent Screen and My Talking Heart, published posthumously by Boise State University through their Hemingway Western Studies Series. The university also houses the Nell Shipman Collection at Albertsons Library. Many of her films were preserved and are available through the library. Nell died at Cabazon, California at the age of 77.</p>\r\n<p><b>Cultural legacy</b><br>\r\nNell Shipman lived for three years in what is known today as The Doctor’s House Museum in Glendale, California, from 1917 to 1920. She described it as on a “tree lined dirt road, away from the hub bub of Hollywood”. It was here that her mother died of the flu epidemic.\r\nThe Canadian playwright Sharon Pollock was commissioned to write a one-act play about Shipman’s life. It was performed in 1999 by the Theatre Junction Resident Company of Artists in Calgary, and was directed by Brian Richmond.\r\nAll of Nell Shipman’s surviving films are available on DVD from Boise State University.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import Heroes from '../../heroes.js'\r\n\r\n    export default { data() { \r\n        return { names: Heroes.filter(h => h.id === 'shipman')[0].names } \r\n    } }\r\n</script>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Shipman.vue?31a8aecd","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class=\"title\">\r\n            <div>{{ names[0] }}\\</div>\r\n            <div>\\{{ names[1] }}</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"paper paper--person\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/heroes/stonehouse.png\">\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<p><b>Ruth Stonehouse</b> (September 28, 1892 – May 12, 1941) was an actress and film director during the silent film era. Her stage career started at the age of eight as a dancer in Arizona shows.</p>\r\n<p><b>Early life and career</b><br>\r\nRuth Stonehouse was born to James Wesley Stonehouse (1869–1958) and Georgia C. Worster on September 28, 1892 in Denver, Colorado. Her father was the founder of Stonehouse Signs Inc.  According to the 1900 Census for Laurence Town, Teller County, Colorado, she lived with her father, James, a sign writer, and her grandmother, Eda Stonehouse, along with her sister, Hazel, who was a year younger. By 1910, she was living with her mother, Georgia Stonehouse, a stenographer, and her sister, Hazel, in Chicago, Illinois. Curiously, her mother lists herself as a widow on the 1910 Census, when James Stonehouse can be found residing in Arizona. Her parents were divorced around 1902. Before her film career, she was a reporter for a Chicago, Illinois newspaper, and contributed short stories to magazines. \r\nShe worked for Triangle Film Corporation and Universal Pictures during a career which extended from 1911 until 1928. A few years prior in 1907, she was a founding member of Essanay Film Manufacturing Company. Having experience here help her begin her directing career later on as she moved to different stations.  Her androgynous appearance was most apparent in the role of Nancy Glenn and in the 1917 motion picture, The Edge of the Law. She performed in comedies and dramas such as the patriotic film Doing Her Bit (1917), which was directed by Jack Conway. \r\nIn 1917, Stonehouse directed the films Daredevil Dan, A Walloping Time, The Winning Pair, A Limb of Satan, Puppy Love  and Tacky Sue’s Romance. These movies were one-reel orphan asylum pictures, the first of which was entitled Mary Ann.</p>\r\n<p><b>Personal life and death</b><br>\r\nRuth owned a cabin in Santa Anita Canyon in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Here she entertained men and women of prominence in the film world, cooking culinary masterpieces which her friends deemed superior to most chefs. Stonehouse was a fan of the Owen Magnetic Auto and promoted it in newspapers. Stonehouse was an avid gardener who grew fibrous-rooted begonias, pleromas, fuchsias, cinerias, and hyacinths. Her home, located at 204 North Rossmore Avenue in Los Angeles, California, was an adaptation of a Spanish design that was situated well to the front of a large lot. She was an active worker in the Children’s Home Society for twenty-five years and also a member of the Garden Club of California.\r\nRuth Stonehouse died in Hollywood, California of a cerebral hemorrhage on May 12, 1941, at the age of 48. She was listed as Mrs. Felix Hughes in her obituary. Her funeral services were conducted from Wee Kirk o’ the Heather. She was interred in a mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import Heroes from '../../heroes.js'\r\n\r\n    export default { data() { \r\n        return { names: Heroes.filter(h => h.id === 'stonehouse')[0].names } \r\n    } }\r\n</script>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Stonehouse.vue?2cdcb6e4","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class=\"title\">\r\n            <div>{{ names[0] }}\\</div>\r\n            <div>\\{{ names[1] }}</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"paper paper--person\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/heroes/warner.png\">\r\n<p><b>Джек Леонард Уорнер</b> (ан&shy;гл. Jack Leonard Warner; 2 августа <br>1892 — 9 сентября <br>1978; имя при рождении Ицхак Вонсколасер) — американский и канадский продюсер и киномагнат еврейского происхождения, который был президентом и «движущей силой» студии Warner Bros. в Голливуде. Карьера Уорнера растянулась приблизительно на сорок пять лет, её продолжительность превысила годы правления всех прочих тогдашних президентов голливудских студий.\r\nВ качестве соруководителя производства на студии Warner Bros. он работал вместе со своим братом, Сэм Уорнером, создав технологию для первого звукового фильма в киноиндустрии «Певец джаза». После смерти Сэма Джек начал длительную борьбу за контроль над компанией со своими старшими братьями, Гарри и Альбертом Уорнерами. Он получил эксклюзивный контроль над фильмами, выпускаемыми компанией, в 1950, когда тайно купил акции своих братьев в бизнесе, убедив их принять участие в совместной продаже акций. Хотя многие из его сотрудников боялись Уорнера и смеялись над ним по причине его своеобразного чувства юмора, он заслужил уважение за его проницательный инстинкт и жёсткость мышления. Он завербовал многих «звёзд» Warner Bros. и способствовал производству бескомпромиссных социальных драм об американской жизни 1930-х годов, которые стали «визитной карточкой» студии и благодаря которым она получила известность. На протяжении своей карьеры он считался противоречивой и загадочной фигурой. Хотя Уорнер был убеждённым сторонником Республиканской партии, он в своих фильмах поддерживал политику «Нового курса» президента от Демократической партии Франклина Делано Рузвельта. Он выступал против европейского фашизма и критиковал политику нацистской Германии задолго до вступления Америки во Вторую мировую войну. Будучи противником коммунизма, после войны Уорнер давал показания в качестве «дружественного свидетеля» перед Комиссией по расследованию антиамериканской деятельности, добровольно называя имена сценаристов, которые затем были уволены по подозрению в том, что были коммунистами или сочувствующими им. Несмотря на его спорную репутацию, Уорнер оставался весьма влиятельным в киноиндустрии до своей отставки в начале 1970-х годов.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<p><b>Jack Leonard “J. L.” Warner</b> (August 2, 1892 – September 9, 1978), born Jacob Warner in London, Ontario, was a Canadian-American film executive who was the president and driving force behind the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Warner’s career spanned some forty-five years, its duration surpassing that of any other of the seminal Hollywood studio moguls. As co-head of production at Warner Bros. Studios, he worked with his brother, Sam Warner, to procure the technology for the film industry’s first talking picture. After Sam’s death, Jack clashed with his surviving older brothers, Harry and Albert Warner. He assumed exclusive control of the film production company in the 1950s, when he secretly purchased his brothers’ shares in the business after convincing them to participate in a joint sale of stocks. Although Warner was feared by many of his employees and inspired ridicule with his uneven attempts at humor, he earned respect for his shrewd instincts and tough-mindedness. He recruited many of Warner Bros.’ top stars and promoted the hard-edged social dramas for which the studio became known. Given to decisiveness, Warner once commented, “If I’m right fifty-one percent of the time, I’m ahead of the game.” Throughout his career, he was viewed as a contradictory and enigmatic figure. Although he was a staunch Republican, Warner encouraged film projects that promoted the agenda of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. He opposed European fascism and criticized Nazi Germany well before America’s involvement in World War II. An opponent of Communism, after the war Warner appeared as a friendly witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee, voluntarily naming screenwriters who had been fired as suspected Communists or sympathizers. Despite his controversial public image, Warner remained a force in the motion picture industry until his retirement in the early 1970s.</p>\r\n<p><b>EARLY YEARS</b><br>\r\nJack Warner was born in London, Ontario, in 1892. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland who spoke mainly Yiddish. Jack was the fifth surviving son of Benjamin Warner  a cobbler from Krasnosielc, Poland (then located in the Congress Kingdom), and his wife, the former Pearl Leah Eichelbaum.  Following their marriage in 1876, the couple had three children in Poland, one of whom died at a young age.  One of the surviving children was Jack’s eldest brother, Hirsch (later Harry).  The Warner family had occupied a “hostile world”, where the “night-riding of cossacks, the burning of houses, and the raping of women were part of life’s burden for the Jews of the ‘shtetl’”.  In 1888, in search of a better future for his family and himself, Benjamin made his way to Hamburg, Germany, and then took a ship to America. The Warner surname was perhaps originally “Wonsal” or “Wonskolaser”  Upon arriving in New York City, Benjamin introduced himself as “Benjamin Warner”, and the surname “Warner” remained with him for the rest of his life.  Pearl Warner and the couple’s two children joined him in Baltimore, Maryland, less than a year later. In Baltimore, the couple had five more children, including Abraham (later known as Albert) and Sam Warner.\r\nBenjamin Warner’s decision to move to Canada in the early 1890s was inspired by a friend’s advice that he could make an excellent living bartering tin wares with trappers in exchange for furs.  Their sons Jack and David were born in Ontario.  After two arduous years in Canada, Benjamin and Pearl Warner returned to Baltimore, bringing along their growing family.  Two more children, Sadie and Milton, were added to the household there.  In 1896, the family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, following the lead of Harry Warner, who established a shoe repair shop in the heart of the emerging industrial town.  Benjamin worked with his son Harry in the shoe repair shop until he secured a loan to open a meat counter and grocery store in the city’s downtown area. \r\nJack spent much of his youth in Youngstown. He observed in his autobiography that his experiences there molded his sensibilities. Warner wrote: “J. Edgar Hoover told me that Youngstown in those days was one of the toughest cities in America, and a gathering place for Sicilian thugs active in the Mafia. There was a murder or two almost every Saturday night in our neighborhood, and knives and brass knuckles were standard equipment for the young hotheads on the prowl.”  Warner claimed that he briefly belonged to a street gang based at Westlake’s Crossing, a notorious neighborhood located just west of the city’s downtown area.  Meanwhile, he received his first taste of show business in the burgeoning steel town, singing at local theaters and forming a brief business partnership with another aspiring “song-and-dance man”.  During his brief career in vaudeville, he officially changed his name to Jack Leonard Warner. Jack’s older brother Sam disapproved of these youthful pursuits. “Get out front where they pay the actors,” Sam Warner advised Jack. “That’s where the money is.”</p> \r\n<p><b>Early business ventures</b><br>\r\nIn Youngstown, the Warner brothers took their first tentative steps into the entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, Sam Warner formed a business partnership with another local resident and “took over” the city’s Old Grand Opera House, which he used as a venue for “cheap vaudeville and photoplays”.  The venture failed after one summer. Sam Warner then secured a job as a projectionist at Idora Park, a local amusement park. He convinced the family of the new medium’s possibilities and negotiated the purchase of a Model B Kinetoscope from a projectionist who was “down on his luck”.  The purchase price was $1,000,  and Jack Warner contributed $150 to the venture by pawning a horse, according to his obituary. \r\nThe enterprising brothers screened a well-used copy of The Great Train Robbery throughout Ohio and Pennsylvania before renting a vacant store in New Castle, Pennsylvania.  This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker.  Jack, who was still living in Youngstown at the time, arrived on weekends “to sing illustrated song-slides during reel changes”.  In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907.  That year, the Warner brothers established the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement Company, a distribution firm that proved lucrative until the advent of Thomas Edison’s Motion Picture Patents Company (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees.  In 1909, Harry agreed to bring Jack into the family business; he sent his younger brother to Norfolk, Virginia, where Jack assisted Sam in the operation of a second film exchange company.  Later that year, the Warners sold the family business to the General Film Company for “$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period for a total of $52,000”  (equivalent to $1,371,837 today).</p>\r\n<p><b>Formation of Warner Bros.</b><br>\r\nThe Warner brothers pooled their resources and moved into film production in 1910.  Then, in 1912, they lent their support to filmmaker Carl Laemmle’s Independent Motion Picture Company, which challenged the monopolistic control of the Edison Trust. That same year, Jack Warner acquired a job as a film splicer in New York, where he assisted brother Sam with the production of the film Dante’s Inferno.  Despite the film’s success at the box office, Harry Warner remained concerned about the economic threat presented by the Edison Trust. He subsequently broke with Laemmle and sent Jack to establish a film exchange in San Francisco, while Sam did the same in Los Angeles.  The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market.  In 1917, Jack was sent to Los Angeles to open another film exchange company.  Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for My Four Years in Germany, a bestselling novel that condemned German wartime atrocities. The film proved to be a commercial and critical success,  and the four brothers were able to establish a studio in California.  In the new studio, Jack became co-head of production along with his older brother, Sam.  In this capacity, the two brothers secured new scripts and story lines, managed film production, and looked for ways to reduce production costs.</p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>Hollywood movie studios, 1922</b><br>\r\nWarner Bros. followed up the success of My Four Years in Germany with a popular serial titled The Tiger’s Claw in 1919. That same year, the studio was less successful in its efforts to promote Open Your Eyes, a tract on the dangers of venereal disease that featured Jack Warner’s sole screen appearance.  During this period, the studio earned few profits;  and in 1920, the Warners secured a bank loan to settle outstanding debts.  Shortly thereafter, the Warners relocated their production studio from Culver City, California, to Hollywood, where they purchased a lot on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Bronson Avenue,  known today as Sunset Bronson Studios. The new location and upgraded facilities did not significantly improve the studio’s image, which remained defined by its low-budget comedies and racy films on declining morality. \r\nThe studio discovered a trained German Shepherd named Rin Tin Tin in 1923. The canine made his debut in Where the North Begins, a film about an abandoned pup who is raised by wolves and befriends a fur trapper.  According to one biographer, Jack Warner’s initial doubts about the project were quelled when he met Rin Tin Tin, “who seemed to display more intelligence than some of the Warner comics.”  Rin Tin Tin proved to be the studio’s most important commercial asset until the introduction of sound.  Screenwriter Darryl F. Zanuckproduced several scripts for Rin Tin Tin vehicles and, during one year, wrote more than half of the studio’s features.  Between 1928 and 1933, Zanuck served as Jack Warner’s right-hand man and executive producer, a position whose responsibilities included the day-to-day production of films.  Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and other projects, however, Warner Bros. was unable to compete with Hollywood’s “Big Three” – Paramount, Universal, and First National studios. \r\nIn 1925, the studio expanded its operations and acquired the Brooklyn-based theater company, Vitagraph.  Later that year, Sam Warner urged his brother, Harry, to sign an agreement with Western Electric to develop a series of talking “shorts” using the newly developed Vitaphone technology.  Sam died of pneumonia in 1927 (just before the premiere of the first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer),  and Jack became sole head of production.  Sam’s death left Jack inconsolable. One biographer writes, “Throughout his life, Jack had been warmed by Sam’s sunshiny optimism, his thirst for excitement, his inventive mind, his gambling nature. Sam had also served as a buffer between Jack and his stern eldest brother, Harry.  In the years to come, Jack ran the Warner Bros. Burbank studio with an iron hand. Following his brother’s death, he became increasingly difficult to deal with and inspired the resentment of many of his employees. \r\nAs the family grieved over Sam’s sudden passing, the success of The Jazz Singer helped establish Warner Bros. as a major studio. While Warner Bros. invested only $500,000 in the film, the studio reaped $3 million in profits.  Hollywood’s five major studios, which controlled most of the nation’s movie theaters, initially attempted to block the growth of “talking pictures”.  In the face of such organized opposition, Warner Bros. produced 12 “talkies” in 1928 alone.  The following year, the newly formed Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Warner Bros. for “revolutionizing the industry with sound”. \r\nDespite Warner Bros.’ new prosperity, Jack kept a tight rein on costs. He placed the studio’s directors on a quota system, and decreed a flat, low-key lighting style to make the sets look cheaper than they were.</p>\r\n<p><b>Depression era</b><br>\r\nThe studio emerged relatively unscathed from the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and produced a broad range of films, including “backstage musicals,” “crusading biopics,” “swashbucklers,” and “women’s pictures.” As Thomas Schatz observed, this repertoire was “a means of stabilizing marketing and sales, of bringing efficiency and economy into the production of some fifty feature films per year, and of distinguishing Warners’ collective output from that of its competitors”.  Warner Bros. became best known, however, for its hard-hitting social dramas, whose production Jack Warner tended to support. These included gangster classics such as Little Caesar and The Public Enemy as well as the critically acclaimed I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, starring Paul Muni.  Some of these films reflected a surprising (albeit temporary) shift in Warner’s political outlook. By 1932, despite his longstanding association with the Republican Party, he openly supported Democratic presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt, staging a “Motion Picture and Electrical Parade Sports Pageant” at L.A. Stadium in Roosevelt’s honor. This development foreshadowed an “era in which Warner would recruit the most New Deal-ish (often simultaneously the most left-wing) writers”. \r\nDuring this period, Warner took an active role in recruiting talent. To furnish Warner Bros. with much needed “star power”, he raided contract players from rival studios, in some cases offering to double their salaries. This strategy yielded three leading stars from Paramount Studios – William Powell, Kay Francis, and Ruth Chatterton. In 1929, Warner persuaded British stage and screen actor George Arliss to play the title role in a remake of the 1921 United Artists film Disraeli, a project that turned out to be a box-office hit.  Then, in 1930, he spotted future stars James Cagney, Joan Blondell, and Frank McHugh in the cast of a New York play called Penny Arcade.  Although Cagney turned out to be Warner’s greatest prize, he was also the studio executive’s biggest professional challenge.  During his frequent arguments with Warner, Cagney often resorted to screaming the Yiddish obscenities he learned during his upbringing in the Hell’s Kitchen district of New York City. According to a 1937 Fortune magazine article, Warner’s most intense contract disputes involved Cagney, “who got sick of being typed as a girl-hitting mick and of making five pictures a year instead of four.” \r\nThe studio’s executive producer, Darryl F. Zanuck, resigned during a contract dispute with Harry Warner in 1933.  According to a 1933 letter that Jack wrote to Will H. Hays, then president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Zanuck requested a higher salary and “indicated his desire to raise the salaries of the actors and personnel in the motion pictures we were producing”.  That year, Zanuck established Twentieth Century Pictures, which merged with Fox Film Corporationin 1935.  Longtime producer for the studio, Hal B. Wallis, took over as the studio’s executive producer.  Warner, however, denied Wallis the sweeping powers enjoyed by Zanuck, and the result was a decentralization of creative and administrative control that often created confusion at the studio.  Under the new system, each picture was assigned a supervisor who was usually plucked from the ranks of the studio’s screenwriters.  Although Warner Bros. maintained a high rate of production throughout the 1930s, some pictures showed an uneven quality that reflected “not only the difficulty of shifting to a supervisory system but also the consequences of dispersing authority into the creative ranks”. \r\nMeanwhile, Jack Warner’s role in production became somewhat limited. After acquiring a creative property, he often had little to do with a film’s production until it was ready for preview.  Nevertheless, Warner could be heavy-handed in his dealings with employees, and he was “merciless in his firings.”  Film director Gottfried Reinhardt claimed that Warner “derived pleasure” from humiliating subordinates.  “Harry Cohn was a sonofabitch,” Reinhardt said, “but he did it for business; he was not a sadist. [Louis B.] Mayer could be a monster, but he was not mean for the sake of meanness. Jack was.” \r\nWarner’s management style frustrated many studio employees. Comedian Jack Benny, who once worked at Warner Bros., quipped, “Jack Warner would rather tell a bad joke than make a good movie”.  Warner frequently clashed with actors and supposedly banned them from the studio’s executive dining room, with the explanation, “I don’t need to look at actors when I eat.”  The studio executive did, however, win the affection of a few film personalities.\r\nAmong these was Bette Davis, one of the studio’s leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract.  In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: “No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. The power. The glory. And he was in business to make money.”  Davis revealed that, after the birth of her child, Warner’s attitude toward her became warm and protective. “We became father and child, no question about it.” she said. “He told me I didn’t have to come back to work until I really felt like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him.”  Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time.  In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn’s contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.</p>\r\n<p><b>The prewar and war years</b><br>\r\nAs the 1930s came to an end, both Jack and Harry Warner became increasingly alarmed over the rise of Nazism.  As Bernard F. Dick observed, the Warners, “as sons of Polish Jews who fled their homeland because of antisemitic pogroms ... had a personal interest in exposing Nazism.” Moreover, the attraction to films critical of German militarism had a long history with the Warners that predated their production of My Four Years in Germany in 1918. In 1917, while it was still in distribution, the Warners had secured the rights for War Brides, a movie that featured Alla Nazimova as “a woman who kills herself rather than breed children for an unidentified country whose army looks suspiciously Teutonic.” \r\nBeyond this, Jack Warner was shaken by the 1936 murder of studio salesman Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin.  Warner later described the incident in the following terms: “Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [Nazi hoodlums] hit him with fists and clubs and then kicked the life out of him with their boots and left him dying there.”  Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism and the loss of European markets, Warner Brothers produced films that were openly critical of Nazi Germany.\r\nIn 1939, the studio published Confessions of a Nazi Spy, starring Edward G. Robinson. The film project, which was recommended to Jack Warner by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, drew on the real-life experiences of agent Leon G. Turrou, who had worked as an undercover agent.  Despite legal ramifications preventing the use of actual names, the studio aimed for an “aura of authenticity”, and Hal Wallis initially recommended eliminating credits to give the film “the appearance of a newsreel.” \r\nConfessions of a Nazi Spy was widely criticized. The critic Pare Lorentz wrote, “The Warner brothers have declared war on Germany with this one.” The German ambassador responded by issuing a protest to Secretary of State Cordell Hull, and the German dictator, Adolf Hitler, who watched the film at Berchtesgaden, was outraged.  Meanwhile, the studio received stern warnings from U.S. Congressman Martin Dies, Jr., about defaming a “friendly country”. \r\nInitially, the studio bowed to pressure from the Roosevelt Administration, the Hays Office, and isolationist lawmakers to desist from similar projects. Jack Warner announced that the studio would release no more “propaganda pictures” and promptly ordered the shelving of several projects with an anti-Nazi theme.  In time, however, Warner Bros. produced more films with anti-Nazi messages, including Underground and All Through the Night. In 1940, the studio produced short films that dramatically documented the devastation wrought by the German bombing raids on London. Meanwhile, the studio celebrated the exploits of the Royal Canadian Air Force, with films such as Captains of the Clouds.  In 1941, Warner also produced the influential prowar film Sergeant York. \r\nContemporary reports that Jack Warner had banned the use of the German language throughout the company’s studios were denied by studio representatives who indicated that this move would have prevented scores of studio employees from communicating with each other. \r\nAfter the American declaration of war against the Axis Powers, Jack Warner, like some other studio heads, was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army. \r\nIn 1943 the studio’s film Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture. When the award was announced, producer Hal B. Wallis got up to accept, only to find Jack Warner had rushed onstage “with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction” to take the trophy, Wallis later recalled. “I couldn’t believe it was happening. Casablanca had been my creation; Jack had absolutely nothing to do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious. ... Almost forty years later, I still haven’t recovered from the shock.” \r\nIn 1943, Warner, at the advice of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, produced a film adaptation of the controversial book Mission to Moscow,  a film intended to inspire public support of the uneasy military alliance that the United States had with the Soviet Union.  Later, while testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee on October 27, 1947,  Warner dismissed allegations during the Cold War that this film was subversive, and he argued that Mission to Moscow was produced “only to help a desperate war effort, and not for posterity.”  After the film’s lackluster response under distribution, the Republican National Committeeaccused Warner of producing it as “New Deal propaganda.” \r\nIn line with the Warner brothers’ early opposition to Nazism, Warner Bros. produced more pictures about the war than any other studio, covering every branch of the armed services.  In addition, the studio produced patriotic musicals such as This is the Army and Yankee Doodle Dandy.</p>\r\n<p><b>Postwar era</b><br>\r\nJack Warner responded grudgingly to the rising popularity of television in the late 1940s.  Initially, he tried to compete with the new medium, introducing gimmicks such as 3-D films, which soon lost their appeal among moviegoers.  In 1954, Warner finally engaged the new medium, providing ABC with a weekly show, Warner Bros. Presents.  The studio followed up with a series of Western dramas, such as Maverick, Bronco, and Colt .45.  Accustomed to dealing with actors in a high-handed manner, within a few years Warner provoked hostility among emerging TV stars like James Garner, who filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over a contract dispute.  He was angered by the perceived ingratitude of television actors, who evidently showed more independence than film actors, and this deepened his contempt for the new medium.  Following his deal with ABC, Warner also made his son, Jack Jr., head of the company’s new television department. \r\nDuring this period, Warner showed little foresight in his treatment of the studio’s cartoon operation. Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, “were always stepchildren at Warner Bros.”  As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, “Jack Warner...considered cartoons no more than an extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers.”  In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio’s cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn’t “even know where the hell the cartoon studio is”, and Harry added, “The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse,” a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions.  Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece. As Thomas noted, “They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros.” \r\nJack Warner’s tumultuous relationship with his brother, Harry, worsened in February 1956, when Harry learned of Jack’s decision to sell the Warner Bros.’ pre-1950 sound films to Associated Artists Productions (soon to merge with United Artists Television) for the modest sum of $21 million.  (The deal did not include the black-and-white Looney Tunes films, the first Merrie Melodie film, Lady, Play Your Mandolin!, and the color cartoons released between August 1, 1948, and the close of 1949. The black-and-white cartoons and the silent films were sold to the Guild Films company under license of Sunset Productions, which was established by Warners as its television subsidiary in the same manner as the Columbia Pictures subsidiary “Screen Gems”, and the aforementioned color cartoons of 1948-49 remained with Warner Brothers). \r\n“This is our heritage, what we worked all our lives to create, and now it is gone,” Harry exclaimed, upon hearing of the deal.  The breach between Jack and Harry widened later that year. In July 1956, Jack, Harry, and Albert announced that they were putting Warner Bros. on the market.  Jack, however, secretly organized a syndicate that purchased control of the company.  By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother’s dealings, it was too late. \r\nJack Warner, as the company’s largest stockholder, appointed himself as the new company president.  Shortly after the deal was closed, Jack Warner announced that the company and its subsidiaries would be “directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties, talents, and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible”. \r\nThe two brothers had often argued, and earlier in the decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, “I’ll get you for this, you son of a bitch” and threatening to kill him.  This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again.  When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d’Antibes.  Asked to respond to his brother’s death, Jack said, “I didn’t give a shit about Harry.”  At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.</p> \r\n<p><b>The Sixties</b><br>\r\nIn the 1960s, Warner kept pace with rapid changes in the industry and played a key role in developing films that were commercial and critical successes. In February 1962, he purchased the film rights for the Broadway musical My Fair Lady, paying an unprecedented $6.5 million. The previous owner, CBS director William S. Paley, set terms that included 50 percent of the distributor’s gross profits “plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract.”  Despite the “outrageous” purchase price, and the ungenerous terms of the contract, the deal proved lucrative for Warner Bros., securing the studio $12 million in profits. Warner was criticized for choosing a non-singing star, Audrey Hepburn, to play the leading role of Eliza Doolittle; indeed, the 1964 Academy Award for Best Actress went to Julie Andrews, who had played Eliza on Broadway and in London, for Mary Poppins, while Audrey Hepburn was not even nominated. However, the film won the best-picture Academy Award for 1964. \r\nIn 1965, Warner surprised many industry observers when he purchased the rights to Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee’s searing play about a destructive marriage.  From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy. Ernest Lehman’s script, which was extremely faithful to Albee’s play, stretched the U.S. film industry’s Production Code to the limit.  Jack Valenti, who just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him “uneasy”.  “I was uncomfortable with the thought that this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight,” Valenti wrote.  Meanwhile, Lehman and the film’s director, Mike Nichols, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white.  These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an “Adults only” label and restrict tickets sales accordingly, all as a marketing tease to entice audiences to see what warranted that restriction. At this, the MPAA — wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film, The Pawnbroker — gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively.  Upon its release, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was embraced by audiences and critics alike. It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966. \r\nDespite these achievements, Jack grew weary of making films, and he sold a substantial amount of his studio stock to Seven Arts Productions on November 14, 1966.  Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.’s executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio.  Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement. His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to “slow down”, and the aging studio head felt a need to put his affairs in order.  Warner sold his 1.6 million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of Lerner & Loewe’s Camelot.  The sale yielded, after capital gains taxes, about $24 million  (equivalent to $171 million today). Eight months after the sale, Warner quipped, “Who would ever have thought that a butcher boy from Youngstown, Ohio, would end up with twenty-four million smackers in his pocket?”  At the time of the sale, Warner had earned the distinction of being the second chief to also serve as company president, after Columbia Pictures’ Harry Cohn.\r\nWarner’s decision to sell came at a time when he was losing the formidable power that he once took for granted. He had already survived the dislocations of the 1950s, when other studio heads – including Louis B. Mayer, David O. Selznick, and Samuel Goldwyn – were pushed out by stockholders who “sought scapegoats for dwindling profits”.  Structural changes that occurred in the industry during this period ensured that studios would become “more important as backers of independent producers than as creators of their own films”, a situation that left little room for the traditional movie mogul.  By the mid-1960s, most of the film moguls from the Golden Age of Hollywood had died, and Warner was regarded as one of the last of a dying breed. Evidence of Warner’s eroding control at Warner Bros. included his failure to block production of the controversial but highly influential film, Bonnie and Clyde, a film project he initially “hated”.  Similarly, as producer of the film adaptation of Camelot, Warner was unable to persuade director Joshua Logan to cast Richard Burton and Julie Andrews in the leading roles. Instead, Logan selected Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave, a move that contributed to the project’s critical – and commercial – failure.  Another factor was that Logan was able to manipulate Warner’s ego to persuade him from cutting the screenplay’s length, despite the fact that the studio executive had already agreed with the film’s unofficial producer, Joel Freeman, that it was overlong.  Warner officially retired from his studio in 1969.</p>\r\n<p><b>After Warner Bros.</b><br>\r\nWarner remained active as an independent producer until the early 1970s. to run some of the company’s distributions and exhibition division.  Among his last productions was a film adaptation of a Broadway musical, 1776, which was released through Columbia Pictures.  Before the film’s release, Warner showed a preview cut to U.S. President Richard Nixon, who recommended substantial changes, including the removal of the song ‘Cool, Cool, Considerate Men’ that struck him as veiled criticisms of the ongoing Vietnam War.  Without consulting the film’s director, Peter H. Hunt, Warner ordered the film re-edited.  The cuts have since been restored in most television showings and in the film’s DVD release.\r\nIn November 1972, the film opened to enthusiastic audiences at Radio City Music Hall, but it fared poorly in theaters.  Faced with a polarized political climate, few Americans were drawn to “a cheery exercise in prerepublic civics”.  Warner’s efforts to promote the film were sometimes counterproductive. During an interview with talk show host Merv Griffin, the elderly producer engaged in a lengthy tirade against “pinko communists”. This was Warner’s first — and last — television interview.</p>\r\n<p><b>Personal life</b><br>\r\nOn October 14, 1914, Warner married Irma Claire Salomon, the adolescent daughter of Sam Saloman and Bertha Franklin Salomon from one of San Francisco’s pioneer Jewish families. Irma Warner gave birth to the couple’s only child, Jack M. Warner on March 27, 1916. Jack Warner named the child after himself, disregarding an Ashkenazi Jewish custom that children should not be named after living relatives. Although his son bore a different middle initial, he “has been called Junior all his life”.  The marriage ended in 1935, when Warner left his wife for another woman, Ann Page. Warner and Ann had a daughter named Barbara.   Irma Warner sued her husband for divorce (a scandalous move at the time) on the grounds of desertion. Jack’s older brother, Harry, reflected the Warner family feelings about the marriage when he exclaimed, “Thank God our mother didn’t live to see this”. Warner married Ann after the divorce. The Warners, who took Irma’s side in the affair, refused to accept Ann as a family member. In the wake of this falling out, Jack’s relationship with his son, Jack Warner Jr., also became strained. \r\nIn the late 1950s, Warner was almost killed in a car accident that left him in a coma for several days. On August 5, 1958, after an evening of baccarat at the Palm Beach Casino in Cannes, Warner’s Alfa Romeo roadster swerved into the path of a coal truck on a stretch of road located near the seaside villa of Prince Aly Khan. Warner was thrown from the car, which burst into flames upon impact. Shortly after the accident, his son, Jack Jr., joined other family members in France, where the unconscious studio head was hospitalized. In an interview with reporters, Jack Jr. suggested that his father was dying. Then, during a visit to his father’s hospital room, the young man offended Ann Warner, whom he largely blamed for his parents’ divorce. When Warner regained consciousness, he was enraged by reports of his son’s behavior, and their “tenuous” relationship came to an end. On December 30, 1958, Jack Jr. was informed, by Jack Sr.’s lawyer Arnold Grant, that the elder Warner had released him from the company. When he attempted to report for work, studio guards denied him entry. The two men never achieved a reconciliation, and Jack Jr. is not mentioned in his father’s 1964 autobiography. Warner made no pretense of faithfulness to his wife, Ann, and kept a series of mistresses throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The most enduring of these “girlfriends” was an aspiring actress named Jackie Park, who bore a “startling” resemblance to Warner’s second wife. The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann Warner pressed her husband to terminate the affair. Although Ann did once have an affair with studio actor Eddie Albert in 1941, she was much more devoted to the marriage by contrast In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Jack Warner had a softer side. In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Warner on his 1964 autobiography, My First Hundred Years in Hollywood, Ann Warner wrote: “He is extremely sensitive, but there are few who know that because he covers it with a cloak.” \r\nAn “ardent Republican”, Jack Warner nevertheless supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal in the early 1930s.  Later in the decade, he made common cause with opponents of Nazi Germany, overlooking ideological differences with those who held leftist political views.  In 1947, however, Warner served as a “friendly witness” for the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), thereby lending support to allegations of a “Red” infiltration of Hollywood.  Warner felt that Communists were responsible for the studio’s month-long strike that occurred in the fall of 1946, and on his own initiative, he provided the names of a dozen screenwriters who were dismissed because of suspected Communist sympathies, a move that effectively destroyed their careers.  Former studio employees named by Warner included Alvah Bessie, Howard Koch, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Robert Rossen, Dalton Trumbo, Clifford Odets, and Irwin Shaw. As one biographer observed, Warner “was furious when Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Paul Henreid and John Huston joined other members of the stellar Committee for the First Amendment in a flight to Washington to preach against the threat to free expression”. Lester D. Friedman noted that Warner’s response to the HUAC hearings was similar to other Jewish studio heads who “feared that a blanket equation of Communists with Jews would destroy them and their industry”.\r\nWarner publicly supported Richard Nixon during the 1960 presidential election and paid for full-page ads in The New York Times “to proclaim why Nixon should be elected”. In the wake of Nixon’s loss to John F. Kennedy, however, the studio head made arrangements to attend a fundraiser at the Los Angeles Palladium in honor of the president-elect. Several weeks later, Warner received a phone call from the new chief executive’s father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and within a short time, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights for Robert Donovan’s book, PT 109, a bestseller concerning John Kennedy’s exploits during World War II. “I don’t think President Kennedy would object to my friendship with Dick Nixon,” Warner said later. “I would have voted for both of them if I could. You might think this is a form of fence-straddling, but I love everybody.” In the late 1960s, he emerged as an outspoken proponent of the Vietnam War.</p>\r\n<p><b>Death and legacy</b><br>\r\nBy the end of 1973, those closest to Warner became aware of signs that he was becoming disoriented. Shortly after losing his way in the building that housed his office, Warner retired. In 1974, Warner suffered a stroke that left him blind and enfeebled. During the next several years, he gradually lost the ability to speak, and became unresponsive to friends and relatives. Finally, on August 13, 1978, Warner was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he died of a heart inflammation (edema) on September 9. He was 86 years old. A funeral service was held at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the synagogue to which many members of the Warner family belonged. He was interred at Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California. \r\nJack Warner left behind an estate estimated at $15 million. Much of the Warner estate, including property and memorabilia, was bequeathed to his widow, Ann. Warner, however, left $200,000 to his estranged son, Jack Jr., perhaps in an effort to discourage him from contesting the will. In the days following Warner’s death, newspaper obituaries recounted the familiar story of “the four brothers who left the family butcher shop for nickelodeons” and went on to revolutionize American cinema. A front-page story in Warner’s adopted hometown of Youngstown featured accounts of the family’s pre-Hollywood struggles in Ohio, describing how Jack Warner drove a wagon for his father’s business when he was only seven years old. The late movie [mogul] was widely eulogized for his role in “shaping Hollywood’s ‘Golden Age’”.\r\nSeveral months after Warner’s death, a more personal tribute was organized by the Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California. The event, called “The Colonel: An Affectionate Remembrance of Jack L. Warner”, drew Hollywood notables such as entertainers Olivia de Havilland and Debbie Reynolds, and cartoon voice actor Mel Blanc. Blanc closed the event with a rendition of Porky Pig’s famous farewell, “A-bee-a-bee-a-bee–that’s all, folks.” In recognition of his contributions to the motion picture industry, Jack Warner was accorded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard. He is also represented on Canada’s Walk of Fame in Toronto, which honours outstanding Canadians from all fields.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import Heroes from '../../heroes.js'\r\n\r\n    export default { data() { \r\n        return { names: Heroes.filter(h => h.id === 'warner')[0].names } \r\n    } }\r\n</script>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Warner.vue?0bb5d0f0","<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n    @import 'styles.scss';\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<template>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class=\"title\">\r\n            <div>{{ names[0] }}\\</div>\r\n            <div>\\{{ names[1] }}</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"paper paper--person\">\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/heroes/weixler.png\">\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"paper__half\">\r\n<p><b>Dorrit Weixler</b> (27 March 1892 – 30 November 1916) was a German film actress of the early 20th century who is best recalled for her comedic roles in German films from the World War I era.</p>\r\n<p><b>Career</b><br>\r\nThe elder sister of actress Grete Weixler, Dorrit Weixler first appeared in silent film shorts for director Alwin Neuß (1879–1935) in 1911. In 1913 she began a successful collaboration with film director Franz Hofer at Luna Film. Hofer began casting Weixler in a number of comedies presenting her as a comedic, temperamental, independent-minded but endearing teenager, often replete in her soon-to-be signature sailor outfit. She often appeared opposite popular German actor and director Ernst Lubitsch and matinee idol Bruno Kastner in her early films with Hofer.[4] Weixler made approximately eleven films with Hofer, and her role as a brassy teen became popular with German filmgoers.\r\nIn 1915 she moved to Oliver Film, but her image was not tampered with significantly. A number of “Dorrit” films were released from 1915 to 1916 which followed her adventures, such as: Dorrit’s Chauffeur (1915), Dorrits Eheglück (English: Dorrit’s Marital Bliss) (1916) and Dorrit bekommt ‘ne Lebensstellung (Dorrit Gets a Job for Life) (1916) for directors such as Paul Otto and Paul Heidemann.</p>\r\n<p><b>Death</b><br>\r\nDuring the end of May 1916, Weixler was at a theater in Nollendorfplatz as part of a “Dorrit Weixler Week”, which was a promotional campaign for the actress. It was Weixler’s first time performing on stage. The audience at the theater was full and Weixler was to entertain the crowd with comedic sketches and dancing. During a dance routine, Weixler collapsed on stage and the show had to be closed. Various speculations were cast by the press for her ailment, including stress or a neurological disorder. The filming of a new movie had to be aborted because of her poor health after her collapse. Later that year Weixler was given morphine, to which she became addicted. She was placed in a sanatorium in Berlin for rest and recovery. On 30 November 1916, aged 24, she committed suicide by hanging herself. She was buried at the Südwestkirchhof cemetery in Stahnsdorf in December of that year. In 1921, five years after her death, Dorittchens Vergnügungsreise (Dorritchen’s Pleasure Cruise) was released to the German public. Filmed in 1916, the film was directed by Paul Heidemann, and Weixler appeared opposite actors Bruno Kastner and Kurt Busch.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n

Карьера Уорнера растянулась приблизительно на сорок пять лет, её продолжительность превысила годы правления всех прочих тогдашних президентов голливудских студий.\\nВ качестве соруководителя производства на студии Warner Bros. он работал вместе со своим братом, Сэм Уорнером, создав технологию для первого звукового фильма в киноиндустрии «Певец джаза». После смерти Сэма Джек начал длительную борьбу за контроль над компанией со своими старшими братьями, Гарри и Альбертом Уорнерами. Он получил эксклюзивный контроль над фильмами, выпускаемыми компанией, в 1950, когда тайно купил акции своих братьев в бизнесе, убедив их принять участие в совместной продаже акций. Хотя многие из его сотрудников боялись Уорнера и смеялись над ним по причине его своеобразного чувства юмора, он заслужил уважение за его проницательный инстинкт и жёсткость мышления. Он завербовал многих «звёзд» Warner Bros. и способствовал производству бескомпромиссных социальных драм об американской жизни 1930-х годов, которые стали «визитной карточкой» студии и благодаря которым она получила известность.

Будучи противником коммунизма, после войны Уорнер давал показания в качестве «дружественного свидетеля» перед Комиссией по расследованию антиамериканской деятельности, добровольно называя имена сценаристов, которые затем были уволены по подозрению в том, что были коммунистами или сочувствующими им.

Studios in Burbank, California. Warner’s career spanned some forty-five years, its duration surpassing that of any other of the seminal Hollywood studio moguls. As co-head of production at Warner Bros. Studios, he worked with his brother, Sam Warner, to procure the technology for the film industry’s first talking picture. After Sam’s death, Jack clashed with his surviving older brothers, Harry and Albert Warner. He assumed exclusive control of the film production company in the 1950s, when he secretly purchased his brothers’ shares in the business after convincing them to participate in a joint sale of stocks. Although Warner was feared by many of his employees and inspired ridicule with his uneven attempts at humor, he earned respect for his shrewd instincts and tough-mindedness. He recruited many of Warner Bros.’ top stars and promoted the hard-edged social dramas for which the studio became known. Given to decisiveness, Warner once commented, “If I’m right fifty-one percent of the time, I’m ahead of the game.” Throughout his career, he was viewed as a contradictory and enigmatic figure. Although he was a staunch Republican, Warner encouraged film projects that promoted the agenda of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. He opposed European fascism and criticized Nazi Germany well before America’s involvement in World War II. An opponent of Communism, after the war Warner appeared as a friendly witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee, voluntarily naming screenwriters who had been fired as suspected Communists or sympathizers.

His parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland who spoke mainly Yiddish. Jack was the fifth surviving son of Benjamin Warner  a cobbler from Krasnosielc, Poland (then located in the Congress Kingdom), and his wife, the former Pearl Leah Eichelbaum.  Following their marriage in 1876, the couple had three children in Poland, one of whom died at a young age.  One of the surviving children was Jack’s eldest brother, Hirsch (later Harry).  The Warner family had occupied a “hostile world”, where the “night-riding of cossacks, the burning of houses, and the raping of women were part of life’s burden for the Jews of the ‘shtetl’”.  In 1888, in search of a better future for his family and himself, Benjamin made his way to Hamburg, Germany, and then took a ship to America. The Warner surname was perhaps originally “Wonsal” or “Wonskolaser”  Upon arriving in New York City, Benjamin introduced himself as “Benjamin Warner”, and the surname “Warner” remained with him for the rest of his life.  Pearl Warner and the couple’s two children joined him in Baltimore, Maryland, less than a year later. In Baltimore, the couple had five more children, including Abraham (later known as Albert) and Sam Warner.\\nBenjamin Warner’s decision to move to Canada in the early 1890s was inspired by a friend’s advice that he could make an excellent living bartering tin wares with trappers in exchange for furs.  Their sons Jack and David were born in Ontario.  After two arduous years in Canada, Benjamin and Pearl Warner returned to Baltimore, bringing along their growing family.  Two more children, Sadie and Milton, were added to the household there.  In 1896, the family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, following the lead of Harry Warner, who established a shoe repair shop in the heart of the emerging industrial town.  Benjamin worked with his son Harry in the shoe repair shop until he secured a loan to open a meat counter and grocery store in the city’s downtown area. \\nJack spent much of his youth in Youngstown. He observed in his autobiography that his experiences there molded his sensibilities. Warner wrote: “J. Edgar Hoover told me that Youngstown in those days was one of the toughest cities in America, and a gathering place for Sicilian thugs active in the Mafia. There was a murder or two almost every Saturday night in our neighborhood, and knives and brass knuckles were standard equipment for the young hotheads on the prowl.”  Warner claimed that he briefly belonged to a street gang based at Westlake’s Crossing, a notorious neighborhood located just west of the city’s downtown area.  Meanwhile, he received his first taste of show business in the burgeoning steel town, singing at local theaters and forming a brief business partnership with another aspiring “song-and-dance man”.  During his brief career in vaudeville, he officially changed his name to Jack Leonard Warner. Jack’s older brother Sam disapproved of these youthful pursuits. “Get out front where they pay the actors,” Sam Warner advised Jack. “That’s where the money is.”\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Early business ventures\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nIn Youngstown, the Warner brothers took their first tentative steps into the entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, Sam Warner formed a business partnership with another local resident and “took over” the city’s Old Grand Opera House, which he used as a venue for “cheap vaudeville and photoplays”.  The venture failed after one summer. Sam Warner then secured a job as a projectionist at Idora Park, a local amusement park. He convinced the family of the new medium’s possibilities and negotiated the purchase of a Model B Kinetoscope from a projectionist who was “down on his luck”.  The purchase price was $1,000,  and Jack Warner contributed $150 to the venture by pawning a horse, according to his obituary. \\nThe enterprising brothers screened a well-used copy of The Great Train Robbery throughout Ohio and Pennsylvania before renting a vacant store in New Castle, Pennsylvania.  This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker.  Jack, who was still living in Youngstown at the time, arrived on weekends “to sing illustrated song-slides during reel changes”.  In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907.  That year, the Warner brothers established the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement Company, a distribution firm that proved lucrative until the advent of Thomas Edison’s Motion Picture Patents Company (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees.  In 1909, Harry agreed to bring Jack into the family business; he sent his younger brother to Norfolk, Virginia, where Jack assisted Sam in the operation of a second film exchange company.  Later that year, the Warners sold the family business to the General Film Company for “$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period for a total of $52,000”  (equivalent to $1,371,837 today).\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Formation of Warner Bros.\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nThe Warner brothers pooled their resources and moved into film production in 1910.  Then, in 1912, they lent their support to filmmaker Carl Laemmle’s Independent Motion Picture Company, which challenged the monopolistic control of the Edison Trust. That same year, Jack Warner acquired a job as a film splicer in New York, where he assisted brother Sam with the production of the film Dante’s Inferno.  Despite the film’s success at the box office, Harry Warner remained concerned about the economic threat presented by the Edison Trust. He subsequently broke with Laemmle and sent Jack to establish a film exchange in San Francisco, while Sam did the same in Los Angeles.  The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market.  In 1917, Jack was sent to Los Angeles to open another film exchange company.  Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for My Four Years in Germany, a bestselling novel that condemned German wartime atrocities. The film proved to be a commercial and critical success,  and the four brothers were able to establish a studio in California.  In the new studio, Jack became co-head of production along with his older brother, Sam.  In this capacity, the two brothers secured new scripts and story lines, managed film production, and looked for ways to reduce production costs.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Hollywood movie studios, 1922\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nWarner Bros. followed up the success of My Four Years in Germany with a popular serial titled The Tiger’s Claw in 1919. That same year, the studio was less successful in its efforts to promote Open Your Eyes, a tract on the dangers of venereal disease that featured Jack Warner’s sole screen appearance.  During this period, the studio earned few profits;  and in 1920, the Warners secured a bank loan to settle outstanding debts.  Shortly thereafter, the Warners relocated their production studio from Culver City, California, to Hollywood, where they purchased a lot on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Bronson Avenue,  known today as Sunset Bronson Studios. The new location and upgraded facilities did not significantly improve the studio’s image, which remained defined by its low-budget comedies and racy films on declining morality. \\nThe studio discovered a trained German Shepherd named Rin Tin Tin in 1923. The canine made his debut in Where the North Begins, a film about an abandoned pup who is raised by wolves and befriends a fur trapper.  According to one biographer, Jack Warner’s initial doubts about the project were quelled when he met Rin Tin Tin, “who seemed to display more intelligence than some of the Warner comics.”  Rin Tin Tin proved to be the studio’s most important commercial asset until the introduction of sound.  Screenwriter Darryl F. Zanuckproduced several scripts for Rin Tin Tin vehicles and, during one year, wrote more than half of the studio’s features.  Between 1928 and 1933, Zanuck served as Jack Warner’s right-hand man and executive producer, a position whose responsibilities included the day-to-day production of films.  Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and other projects, however, Warner Bros. was unable to compete with Hollywood’s “Big Three” – Paramount, Universal, and First National studios. \\nIn 1925, the studio expanded its operations and acquired the Brooklyn-based theater company, Vitagraph.  Later that year, Sam Warner urged his brother, Harry, to sign an agreement with Western Electric to develop a series of talking “shorts” using the newly developed Vitaphone technology.  Sam died of pneumonia in 1927 (just before the premiere of the first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer),  and Jack became sole head of production.  Sam’s death left Jack inconsolable. One biographer writes, “Throughout his life, Jack had been warmed by Sam’s sunshiny optimism, his thirst for excitement, his inventive mind, his gambling nature. Sam had also served as a buffer between Jack and his stern eldest brother, Harry.  In the years to come, Jack ran the Warner Bros. Burbank studio with an iron hand. Following his brother’s death, he became increasingly difficult to deal with and inspired the resentment of many of his employees. \\nAs the family grieved over Sam’s sudden passing, the success of The Jazz Singer helped establish Warner Bros. as a major studio. While Warner Bros. invested only $500,000 in the film, the studio reaped $3 million in profits.  Hollywood’s five major studios, which controlled most of the nation’s movie theaters, initially attempted to block the growth of “talking pictures”.  In the face of such organized opposition, Warner Bros. produced 12 “talkies” in 1928 alone.  The following year, the newly formed Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Warner Bros. for “revolutionizing the industry with sound”. \\nDespite Warner Bros.’ new prosperity, Jack kept a tight rein on costs. He placed the studio’s directors on a quota system, and decreed a flat, low-key lighting style to make the sets look cheaper than they were.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Depression era\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nThe studio emerged relatively unscathed from the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and produced a broad range of films, including “backstage musicals,” “crusading biopics,” “swashbucklers,” and “women’s pictures.” As Thomas Schatz observed, this repertoire was “a means of stabilizing marketing and sales, of bringing efficiency and economy into the production of some fifty feature films per year, and of distinguishing Warners’ collective output from that of its competitors”.  Warner Bros. became best known, however, for its hard-hitting social dramas, whose production Jack Warner tended to support. These included gangster classics such as Little Caesar and The Public Enemy as well as the critically acclaimed I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, starring Paul Muni.  Some of these films reflected a surprising (albeit temporary) shift in Warner’s political outlook. By 1932, despite his longstanding association with the Republican Party, he openly supported Democratic presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt, staging a “Motion Picture and Electrical Parade Sports Pageant” at L.A. Stadium in Roosevelt’s honor. This development foreshadowed an “era in which Warner would recruit the most New Deal-ish (often simultaneously the most left-wing) writers”. \\nDuring this period, Warner took an active role in recruiting talent. To furnish Warner Bros. with much needed “star power”, he raided contract players from rival studios, in some cases offering to double their salaries. This strategy yielded three leading stars from Paramount Studios – William Powell, Kay Francis, and Ruth Chatterton. In 1929, Warner persuaded British stage and screen actor George Arliss to play the title role in a remake of the 1921 United Artists film Disraeli, a project that turned out to be a box-office hit.  Then, in 1930, he spotted future stars James Cagney, Joan Blondell, and Frank McHugh in the cast of a New York play called Penny Arcade.  Although Cagney turned out to be Warner’s greatest prize, he was also the studio executive’s biggest professional challenge.  During his frequent arguments with Warner, Cagney often resorted to screaming the Yiddish obscenities he learned during his upbringing in the Hell’s Kitchen district of New York City. According to a 1937 Fortune magazine article, Warner’s most intense contract disputes involved Cagney, “who got sick of being typed as a girl-hitting mick and of making five pictures a year instead of four.” \\nThe studio’s executive producer, Darryl F. Zanuck, resigned during a contract dispute with Harry Warner in 1933.  According to a 1933 letter that Jack wrote to Will H. Hays, then president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Zanuck requested a higher salary and “indicated his desire to raise the salaries of the actors and personnel in the motion pictures we were producing”.  That year, Zanuck established Twentieth Century Pictures, which merged with Fox Film Corporationin 1935.  Longtime producer for the studio, Hal B. Wallis, took over as the studio’s executive producer.  Warner, however, denied Wallis the sweeping powers enjoyed by Zanuck, and the result was a decentralization of creative and administrative control that often created confusion at the studio.  Under the new system, each picture was assigned a supervisor who was usually plucked from the ranks of the studio’s screenwriters.  Although Warner Bros. maintained a high rate of production throughout the 1930s, some pictures showed an uneven quality that reflected “not only the difficulty of shifting to a supervisory system but also the consequences of dispersing authority into the creative ranks”. \\nMeanwhile, Jack Warner’s role in production became somewhat limited. After acquiring a creative property, he often had little to do with a film’s production until it was ready for preview.  Nevertheless, Warner could be heavy-handed in his dealings with employees, and he was “merciless in his firings.”  Film director Gottfried Reinhardt claimed that Warner “derived pleasure” from humiliating subordinates.  “Harry Cohn was a sonofabitch,” Reinhardt said, “but he did it for business; he was not a sadist. [Louis B.] Mayer could be a monster, but he was not mean for the sake of meanness. Jack was.” \\nWarner’s management style frustrated many studio employees. Comedian Jack Benny, who once worked at Warner Bros., quipped, “Jack Warner would rather tell a bad joke than make a good movie”.  Warner frequently clashed with actors and supposedly banned them from the studio’s executive dining room, with the explanation, “I don’t need to look at actors when I eat.”  The studio executive did, however, win the affection of a few film personalities.\\nAmong these was Bette Davis, one of the studio’s leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract.  In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: “No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. The power. The glory. And he was in business to make money.”  Davis revealed that, after the birth of her child, Warner’s attitude toward her became warm and protective. “We became father and child, no question about it.” she said. “He told me I didn’t have to come back to work until I really felt like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him.”  Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time.  In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn’s contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"The prewar and war years\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nAs the 1930s came to an end, both Jack and Harry Warner became increasingly alarmed over the rise of Nazism.  As Bernard F. Dick observed, the Warners, “as sons of Polish Jews who fled their homeland because of antisemitic pogroms ... had a personal interest in exposing Nazism.” Moreover, the attraction to films critical of German militarism had a long history with the Warners that predated their production of My Four Years in Germany in 1918. In 1917, while it was still in distribution, the Warners had secured the rights for War Brides, a movie that featured Alla Nazimova as “a woman who kills herself rather than breed children for an unidentified country whose army looks suspiciously Teutonic.” \\nBeyond this, Jack Warner was shaken by the 1936 murder of studio salesman Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin.  Warner later described the incident in the following terms: “Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [Nazi hoodlums] hit him with fists and clubs and then kicked the life out of him with their boots and left him dying there.”  Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism and the loss of European markets, Warner Brothers produced films that were openly critical of Nazi Germany.\\nIn 1939, the studio published Confessions of a Nazi Spy, starring Edward G. Robinson. The film project, which was recommended to Jack Warner by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, drew on the real-life experiences of agent Leon G. Turrou, who had worked as an undercover agent.  Despite legal ramifications preventing the use of actual names, the studio aimed for an “aura of authenticity”, and Hal Wallis initially recommended eliminating credits to give the film “the appearance of a newsreel.” \\nConfessions of a Nazi Spy was widely criticized. The critic Pare Lorentz wrote, “The Warner brothers have declared war on Germany with this one.” The German ambassador responded by issuing a protest to Secretary of State Cordell Hull, and the German dictator, Adolf Hitler, who watched the film at Berchtesgaden, was outraged.  Meanwhile, the studio received stern warnings from U.S. Congressman Martin Dies, Jr., about defaming a “friendly country”. \\nInitially, the studio bowed to pressure from the Roosevelt Administration, the Hays Office, and isolationist lawmakers to desist from similar projects. Jack Warner announced that the studio would release no more “propaganda pictures” and promptly ordered the shelving of several projects with an anti-Nazi theme.  In time, however, Warner Bros. produced more films with anti-Nazi messages, including Underground and All Through the Night. In 1940, the studio produced short films that dramatically documented the devastation wrought by the German bombing raids on London. Meanwhile, the studio celebrated the exploits of the Royal Canadian Air Force, with films such as Captains of the Clouds.  In 1941, Warner also produced the influential prowar film Sergeant York. \\nContemporary reports that Jack Warner had banned the use of the German language throughout the company’s studios were denied by studio representatives who indicated that this move would have prevented scores of studio employees from communicating with each other. \\nAfter the American declaration of war against the Axis Powers, Jack Warner, like some other studio heads, was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army. \\nIn 1943 the studio’s film Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture. When the award was announced, producer Hal B. Wallis got up to accept, only to find Jack Warner had rushed onstage “with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction” to take the trophy, Wallis later recalled. “I couldn’t believe it was happening. Casablanca had been my creation; Jack had absolutely nothing to do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious. ... Almost forty years later, I still haven’t recovered from the shock.” \\nIn 1943, Warner, at the advice of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, produced a film adaptation of the controversial book Mission to Moscow,  a film intended to inspire public support of the uneasy military alliance that the United States had with the Soviet Union.  Later, while testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee on October 27, 1947,  Warner dismissed allegations during the Cold War that this film was subversive, and he argued that Mission to Moscow was produced “only to help a desperate war effort, and not for posterity.”  After the film’s lackluster response under distribution, the Republican National Committeeaccused Warner of producing it as “New Deal propaganda.” \\nIn line with the Warner brothers’ early opposition to Nazism, Warner Bros. produced more pictures about the war than any other studio, covering every branch of the armed services.  In addition, the studio produced patriotic musicals such as This is the Army and Yankee Doodle Dandy.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Postwar era\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nJack Warner responded grudgingly to the rising popularity of television in the late 1940s.  Initially, he tried to compete with the new medium, introducing gimmicks such as 3-D films, which soon lost their appeal among moviegoers.  In 1954, Warner finally engaged the new medium, providing ABC with a weekly show, Warner Bros. Presents.  The studio followed up with a series of Western dramas, such as Maverick, Bronco, and Colt .45.  Accustomed to dealing with actors in a high-handed manner, within a few years Warner provoked hostility among emerging TV stars like James Garner, who filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over a contract dispute.  He was angered by the perceived ingratitude of television actors, who evidently showed more independence than film actors, and this deepened his contempt for the new medium.  Following his deal with ABC, Warner also made his son, Jack Jr., head of the company’s new television department. \\nDuring this period, Warner showed little foresight in his treatment of the studio’s cartoon operation. Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, “were always stepchildren at Warner Bros.”  As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, “Jack Warner...considered cartoons no more than an extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers.”  In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio’s cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn’t “even know where the hell the cartoon studio is”, and Harry added, “The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse,” a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions.  Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece. As Thomas noted, “They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros.” \\nJack Warner’s tumultuous relationship with his brother, Harry, worsened in February 1956, when Harry learned of Jack’s decision to sell the Warner Bros.’ pre-1950 sound films to Associated Artists Productions (soon to merge with United Artists Television) for the modest sum of $21 million.  (The deal did not include the black-and-white Looney Tunes films, the first Merrie Melodie film, Lady, Play Your Mandolin!, and the color cartoons released between August 1, 1948, and the close of 1949. The black-and-white cartoons and the silent films were sold to the Guild Films company under license of Sunset Productions, which was established by Warners as its television subsidiary in the same manner as the Columbia Pictures subsidiary “Screen Gems”, and the aforementioned color cartoons of 1948-49 remained with Warner Brothers). \\n“This is our heritage, what we worked all our lives to create, and now it is gone,” Harry exclaimed, upon hearing of the deal.  The breach between Jack and Harry widened later that year. In July 1956, Jack, Harry, and Albert announced that they were putting Warner Bros. on the market.  Jack, however, secretly organized a syndicate that purchased control of the company.  By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother’s dealings, it was too late. \\nJack Warner, as the company’s largest stockholder, appointed himself as the new company president.  Shortly after the deal was closed, Jack Warner announced that the company and its subsidiaries would be “directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties, talents, and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible”. \\nThe two brothers had often argued, and earlier in the decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, “I’ll get you for this, you son of a bitch” and threatening to kill him.  This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again.  When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d’Antibes.  Asked to respond to his brother’s death, Jack said, “I didn’t give a shit about Harry.”  At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"The Sixties\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nIn the 1960s, Warner kept pace with rapid changes in the industry and played a key role in developing films that were commercial and critical successes. In February 1962, he purchased the film rights for the Broadway musical My Fair Lady, paying an unprecedented $6.5 million. The previous owner, CBS director William S. Paley, set terms that included 50 percent of the distributor’s gross profits “plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract.”  Despite the “outrageous” purchase price, and the ungenerous terms of the contract, the deal proved lucrative for Warner Bros., securing the studio $12 million in profits. Warner was criticized for choosing a non-singing star, Audrey Hepburn, to play the leading role of Eliza Doolittle; indeed, the 1964 Academy Award for Best Actress went to Julie Andrews, who had played Eliza on Broadway and in London, for Mary Poppins, while Audrey Hepburn was not even nominated. However, the film won the best-picture Academy Award for 1964. \\nIn 1965, Warner surprised many industry observers when he purchased the rights to Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee’s searing play about a destructive marriage.  From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy. Ernest Lehman’s script, which was extremely faithful to Albee’s play, stretched the U.S. film industry’s Production Code to the limit.  Jack Valenti, who just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him “uneasy”.  “I was uncomfortable with the thought that this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight,” Valenti wrote.  Meanwhile, Lehman and the film’s director, Mike Nichols, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white.  These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an “Adults only” label and restrict tickets sales accordingly, all as a marketing tease to entice audiences to see what warranted that restriction. At this, the MPAA — wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film, The Pawnbroker — gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively.  Upon its release, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was embraced by audiences and critics alike. It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966. \\nDespite these achievements, Jack grew weary of making films, and he sold a substantial amount of his studio stock to Seven Arts Productions on November 14, 1966.  Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.’s executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio.  Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement. His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to “slow down”, and the aging studio head felt a need to put his affairs in order.  Warner sold his 1.6 million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of Lerner & Loewe’s Camelot.  The sale yielded, after capital gains taxes, about $24 million  (equivalent to $171 million today). Eight months after the sale, Warner quipped, “Who would ever have thought that a butcher boy from Youngstown, Ohio, would end up with twenty-four million smackers in his pocket?”  At the time of the sale, Warner had earned the distinction of being the second chief to also serve as company president, after Columbia Pictures’ Harry Cohn.\\nWarner’s decision to sell came at a time when he was losing the formidable power that he once took for granted. He had already survived the dislocations of the 1950s, when other studio heads – including Louis B. Mayer, David O. Selznick, and Samuel Goldwyn – were pushed out by stockholders who “sought scapegoats for dwindling profits”.  Structural changes that occurred in the industry during this period ensured that studios would become “more important as backers of independent producers than as creators of their own films”, a situation that left little room for the traditional movie mogul.  By the mid-1960s, most of the film moguls from the Golden Age of Hollywood had died, and Warner was regarded as one of the last of a dying breed. Evidence of Warner’s eroding control at Warner Bros. included his failure to block production of the controversial but highly influential film, Bonnie and Clyde, a film project he initially “hated”.  Similarly, as producer of the film adaptation of Camelot, Warner was unable to persuade director Joshua Logan to cast Richard Burton and Julie Andrews in the leading roles. Instead, Logan selected Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave, a move that contributed to the project’s critical – and commercial – failure.  Another factor was that Logan was able to manipulate Warner’s ego to persuade him from cutting the screenplay’s length, despite the fact that the studio executive had already agreed with the film’s unofficial producer, Joel Freeman, that it was overlong.  Warner officially retired from his studio in 1969.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"After Warner Bros.\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nWarner remained active as an independent producer until the early 1970s. to run some of the company’s distributions and exhibition division.  Among his last productions was a film adaptation of a Broadway musical, 1776, which was released through Columbia Pictures.  Before the film’s release, Warner showed a preview cut to U.S. President Richard Nixon, who recommended substantial changes, including the removal of the song ‘Cool, Cool, Considerate Men’ that struck him as veiled criticisms of the ongoing Vietnam War.  Without consulting the film’s director, Peter H. Hunt, Warner ordered the film re-edited.  The cuts have since been restored in most television showings and in the film’s DVD release.\\nIn November 1972, the film opened to enthusiastic audiences at Radio City Music Hall, but it fared poorly in theaters.  Faced with a polarized political climate, few Americans were drawn to “a cheery exercise in prerepublic civics”.  Warner’s efforts to promote the film were sometimes counterproductive. During an interview with talk show host Merv Griffin, the elderly producer engaged in a lengthy tirade against “pinko communists”.

Irma Warner gave birth to the couple’s only child, Jack M. Warner on March 27, 1916. Jack Warner named the child after himself, disregarding an Ashkenazi Jewish custom that children should not be named after living relatives. Although his son bore a different middle initial, he “has been called Junior all his life”.  The marriage ended in 1935, when Warner left his wife for another woman, Ann Page. Warner and Ann had a daughter named Barbara.   Irma Warner sued her husband for divorce (a scandalous move at the time) on the grounds of desertion. Jack’s older brother, Harry, reflected the Warner family feelings about the marriage when he exclaimed, “Thank God our mother didn’t live to see this”. Warner married Ann after the divorce. The Warners, who took Irma’s side in the affair, refused to accept Ann as a family member. In the wake of this falling out, Jack’s relationship with his son, Jack Warner Jr., also became strained. \\nIn the late 1950s, Warner was almost killed in a car accident that left him in a coma for several days. On August 5, 1958, after an evening of baccarat at the Palm Beach Casino in Cannes, Warner’s Alfa Romeo roadster swerved into the path of a coal truck on a stretch of road located near the seaside villa of Prince Aly Khan. Warner was thrown from the car, which burst into flames upon impact. Shortly after the accident, his son, Jack Jr., joined other family members in France, where the unconscious studio head was hospitalized. In an interview with reporters, Jack Jr. suggested that his father was dying. Then, during a visit to his father’s hospital room, the young man offended Ann Warner, whom he largely blamed for his parents’ divorce. When Warner regained consciousness, he was enraged by reports of his son’s behavior, and their “tenuous” relationship came to an end. On December 30, 1958, Jack Jr. was informed, by Jack Sr.’s lawyer Arnold Grant, that the elder Warner had released him from the company. When he attempted to report for work, studio guards denied him entry. The two men never achieved a reconciliation, and Jack Jr. is not mentioned in his father’s 1964 autobiography. Warner made no pretense of faithfulness to his wife, Ann, and kept a series of mistresses throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The most enduring of these “girlfriends” was an aspiring actress named Jackie Park, who bore a “startling” resemblance to Warner’s second wife. The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann Warner pressed her husband to terminate the affair. Although Ann did once have an affair with studio actor Eddie Albert in 1941, she was much more devoted to the marriage by contrast In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Jack Warner had a softer side. In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Warner on his 1964 autobiography, My First Hundred Years in Hollywood, Ann Warner wrote: “He is extremely sensitive, but there are few who know that because he covers it with a cloak.” \\nAn “ardent Republican”, Jack Warner nevertheless supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal in the early 1930s.  Later in the decade, he made common cause with opponents of Nazi Germany, overlooking ideological differences with those who held leftist political views.  In 1947, however, Warner served as a “friendly witness” for the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), thereby lending support to allegations of a “Red” infiltration of Hollywood.  Warner felt that Communists were responsible for the studio’s month-long strike that occurred in the fall of 1946, and on his own initiative, he provided the names of a dozen screenwriters who were dismissed because of suspected Communist sympathies, a move that effectively destroyed their careers.  Former studio employees named by Warner included Alvah Bessie, Howard Koch, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Robert Rossen, Dalton Trumbo, Clifford Odets, and Irwin Shaw. As one biographer observed, Warner “was furious when Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Paul Henreid and John Huston joined other members of the stellar Committee for the First Amendment in a flight to Washington to preach against the threat to free expression”. Lester D. Friedman noted that Warner’s response to the HUAC hearings was similar to other Jewish studio heads who “feared that a blanket equation of Communists with Jews would destroy them and their industry”.\\nWarner publicly supported Richard Nixon during the 1960 presidential election and paid for full-page ads in The New York Times “to proclaim why Nixon should be elected”. In the wake of Nixon’s loss to John F. Kennedy, however, the studio head made arrangements to attend a fundraiser at the Los Angeles Palladium in honor of the president-elect. Several weeks later, Warner received a phone call from the new chief executive’s father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and within a short time, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights for Robert Donovan’s book, PT 109, a bestseller concerning John Kennedy’s exploits during World War II. “I don’t think President Kennedy would object to my friendship with Dick Nixon,” Warner said later. “I would have voted for both of them if I could. You might think this is a form of fence-straddling, but I love everybody.” In the late 1960s, he emerged as an outspoken proponent of the Vietnam War.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Death and legacy\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nBy the end of 1973, those closest to Warner became aware of signs that he was becoming disoriented. Shortly after losing his way in the building that housed his office, Warner retired. In 1974, Warner suffered a stroke that left him blind and enfeebled. During the next several years, he gradually lost the ability to speak, and became unresponsive to friends and relatives. Finally, on August 13, 1978, Warner was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he died of a heart inflammation (edema) on September 9. He was 86 years old. A funeral service was held at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the synagogue to which many members of the Warner family belonged. He was interred at Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California. \\nJack Warner left behind an estate estimated at $15 million. Much of the Warner estate, including property and memorabilia, was bequeathed to his widow, Ann. Warner, however, left $200,000 to his estranged son, Jack Jr., perhaps in an effort to discourage him from contesting the will. In the days following Warner’s death, newspaper obituaries recounted the familiar story of “the four brothers who left the family butcher shop for nickelodeons” and went on to revolutionize American cinema. A front-page story in Warner’s adopted hometown of Youngstown featured accounts of the family’s pre-Hollywood struggles in Ohio, describing how Jack Warner drove a wagon for his father’s business when he was only seven years old. The late movie [mogul] was widely eulogized for his role in “shaping Hollywood’s ‘Golden Age’”.\\nSeveral months after Warner’s death, a more personal tribute was organized by the Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California. The event, called “The Colonel: An Affectionate Remembrance of Jack L.

Aoki was later adopted by another uncle Aoki Toshio and relocated to San Francisco. Toshio worked as a sketch artist for a local newspaper. Tsuru Aoki started taking lessons in ballet dance in New York, when she went along with her uncle Toshio, who was hired by David Belasco for The Darling of the Gods. After Toshio’s death a reporter looked after Aoki.  Aoki began her acting career after returning to Los Angeles and performing in stage productions in the city’s Japanese Theatre where she was noticed by film producer Thomas Ince who placed the young actress under contract. She was also responsible for recruiting Japanese actors for Imperial Japanese Company, a subsidiary of New York Motion Picture Corporation.  Aoki made her film debut in the Majestic film studios release The Oath of Tsuru San in 1913 opposite actor William Garwood. Her follow-up film was the 1914 Ince produced O Mimi San, which starred the American child actress Mildred Harris and a handsome young newcomer named Sessue Hayakawa, whom Aoki had acted with onstage at the Japanese Theatre the previous year. The couple began a romantic relationship that would culminate in their marriage on May 1, 1914, just weeks before the release of their critically acclaimed and publicly successful film The Wrath of the Gods – a melodrama about an interracial romance between a man portrayed by Caucasian actor/director Frank Borzage and an Asian woman portrayed by Aoki. The film also starred Sessue Hayakawa and featured actress Gladys Brockwell. Hayakawa and Aoki would eventually make more than twenty films together throughout the 1910s and 1920s.\\nOne of Aoki’s most recalled films of the silent period is the 1919 William Worthington-directed The Dragon Painter, in which Aoki starred, playing a young woman who convinces an isolated, mentally deranged artist named Tatsu (portrayed by Hayakawa) to come down from the mountains so that she may civilize him and he may further his artistic abilities. Other notable films of the period were The Typhoon (1914), The Vigil (1914), The Geisha (1914), The Chinatown Mystery (1915), His Birthright (1918), and The Breath of the Gods (1920). Throughout the 1910s, Aoki would appear in approximately forty films, often in leading-lady roles which was a first for an Asian actress. Some of her co-stars of the era included such notable names as Marin Sais, Frank Borzage, Gladys Brockwell, Mildred Harris, Jack Holt, Jane Wolfe, Dagmar Godowsky, Vola Vale, Florence Vidor, Earle Foxe, and Walter Long. After a series of moderately successful Ince-produced two-reel serials, Aoki’s career in the United States began to falter (while her husband’s career began to build momentum), and the couple travelled to France in 1923 and filmed the popular Édouard-Émile Violet-directed drama La Bataille. After returning to America, however, Aoki made only three more films before retiring from the screen to raise her and Hayakawa’s three adopted children. Her last silent screen performance was the 1924 release The Danger Line. Aoki would only return to the screen in 1960 (her first talkie) to once again appear with her husband in the drama Hell to Eternity. She died the following year in Japan of acute peritonitis at the age of 69.\")])])])\n}]}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/vue-loader/lib/template-compiler.js?id=data-v-18094490!./~/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=template&index=0!./src/views/people/Aoki.vue\n// module id = 98\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports={render:function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"container--center\"\n  }, [_c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"wrapper\"\n  }, [_c('c-header', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"title\": ['Кино', 'Cinema'],\n      \"oq\": true\n    }\n  }), _vm._v(\" \"), _vm._m(0)])])\n},staticRenderFns: [function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"double-text\"\n  }, [_c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"double-text__black\"\n  }, [_vm._v(\"\\n                «Бедный Пьеро»\"), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\n                «Клоун и его собачки»\"), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\n                «Кружка пива»\\n            \")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"double-text__blue\"\n  }, [_vm._v(\"\\n                Pauvre Pierrot\"), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\n                Clown et ses chiens\"), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\n                Un bon bock\\n            \")])])\n}]}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/vue-loader/lib/template-compiler.js?id=data-v-1a12e6fc!./~/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=template&index=0!./src/views/Cinema.vue\n// module id = 99\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports={render:function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('div', [_c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"title\"\n  }, [_c('div', [_vm._v(_vm._s(_vm.names[0]) + \"\\\\\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('div', [_vm._v(\"\\\\\" + _vm._s(_vm.names[1]))])]), _vm._v(\" \"), _vm._m(0)])\n},staticRenderFns: [function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"paper paper--person\"\n  }, [_c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"paper__half\"\n  }, [_c('img', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"src\": require(\"../../assets/images/heroes/normand.png\")\n    }\n  }), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Мэйбл Норманд\")]), _vm._v(\" (англ.

Dines, who was shot by Normand’s chauffeur using her pistol. She was not a suspect in either crime.

Normand’s mother was of Irish heritage, while her father was French Canadian.  Her father Claude Normand was employed as a cabinet maker and stage carpenter at Sailors’ Snug Harbor home for elderly seamen. Before she entered films at age 16 in 1909, Normand worked as an artist’s model, which included posing for postcards illustrated by Charles Dana Gibson, creator of the Gibson Girl image, as well as for Butterick’s clothing pattern manufacturers in lower Manhattan. For a short time, she worked for Vitagraph Studios in New York City for $25 per week, but Vitagraph founder Albert E. Smith admitted she was one of several actresses about whom he made a mistake in estimating their “potential for future stardom.”  Her quietly effervescent lead performance, while directed by D. W. Griffith in the dramatic 1911 short film Her Awakening, drew attention and she met director Mack Sennett while at Griffith’s Biograph Company. She embarked on a topsy-turvy relationship with him; he later brought her across to California when he founded Keystone Studios in 1912. Her earlier Keystone films portrayed her as a bathing beauty but Normand quickly demonstrated a flair for comedy and became a major star of Sennett’s short films. Normand appeared with Charles Chaplin and Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle in many short films as well as Oliver Hardy, Stan Laurel, and Boris Karloff.\\nShe played a key role in starting Chaplin’s film career and acted as his leading lady and mentor in a string of films in 1914, sometimes co-writing and directing or co-directing films with him. Chaplin had considerable initial difficulty adjusting to the demands of film acting and his performance suffered for it. After his first film appearance in Making a Living, Sennett felt he had made a costly mistake.  Most historians agree it was Normand who persuaded him to give Chaplin another chance,  and she and Chaplin appeared together in a dozen subsequent films, almost always as a couple in the lead roles. In 1914, she starred with Marie Dressler and Chaplin in Tillie’s Punctured Romance, the first feature-length comedy. Earlier that same year, in January/February, Chaplin first played his Tramp character in Mabel’s Strange Predicament, although it wound up being the second Tramp film released; Chaplin offers an account of his experience on the film in his autobiography. \\nShe opened her own company in partnership with Mack Sennett 1916. It was based in Culver City and was a subsidiary of the Triangle Film Corperation. She lost the company in 1918 when Triangle experienced a massive shake up which also saw Sennett lose Keystone and establish his own independent studio.\\nIn 1918, as her relationship with Sennett came to an end, Normand signed a $3,500 per week contract with Samuel Goldwyn.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Taylor’s murder\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nDirector William Desmond Taylor shared her interest in books, and the two formed a close relationship.

Based upon Normand’s subsequent statements to investigators, her repeated relapses were devastating for Taylor. According to Giroux, Taylor met with federal prosecutors shortly before his death and offered to assist them in filing charges against Normand’s cocaine suppliers. Giroux expresses a belief that Normand’s suppliers learned of this meeting and hired a contract killer to murder the director. According to Giroux, Normand suspected the reasons for Taylor’s murder, but did not know the identity of the man who killed him.According to Kevin Brownlow and John Kobal in their book Hollywood The Pioneers the idea that Taylor was murdered by drug dealers was invented by the studio for publicity purposes.  There is no evidence that Normand was an addict, despite the fact that this is often repeated as if it were established fact.\\nOn the night of his murder, February 1, 1922, Normand left Taylor’s bungalow at 7:45 p.m. in a happy mood, carrying a book he had lent her.

The Los Angeles Police Department subjected Normand to a grueling interrogation, but ruled her out as a suspect.  Most subsequent writers have done the same.

By the time Dreyer watched her act in an amateur theater and selected her as his leading lady in his upcoming production La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc, she was already a celebrated stage artiste, and had appeared in one film, La Comtesse de Somerive (1917), directed by Georges Denola and Jean Kemm. Falconetti was 35 years old when she played the role of 19-year-old Joan of Arc in La Passion. Her portrayal is widely considered one of the most astonishing performances ever committed to film, and it would remain her final cinematic role.\\nMany writers have claimed that Falconetti’s performance was the result of extreme cruelty at the hands of Dreyer, a notoriously demanding director who pushed her to the brink of emotional collapse. For example, film critic Roger Ebert writes,\\nFor Falconetti, the performance was an ordeal. Legends from the set tell of Dreyer forcing her to kneel painfully on stone and then wipe all expression from her face – so that the viewer would read suppressed or inner pain. He filmed the same shots again and again, hoping that in the editing room he could find exactly the right nuance in her facial expression. \\nHowever, in their biography of Dreyer, Jean and Dale Drum say that these stories are based only on rumour and that “there is no evidence that Dreyer could be called a sadist”.  They quote onlookers who described Dreyer’s working relationship with Falconetti: initially in the production process, “Dreyer and Falconetti would watch the rushes of a single scene together, seven or eight times, until Dreyer could pick out a little bit, maybe a few feet, where the effect was what they wanted, and when they reshot the scene, she could play it without the least inhibition. Just those few feet of film had inspired her.” Later, Falconetti became able to play scenes only from Dreyer’s explanations, without the need even for rehearsal. \\nSubsequent career \\nAfter filming Joan of Arc, Falconetti continued with her career as a producer of light stage comedies, appearing with the Comédie-Française. During the Second World War, she escaped from France first to Switzerland, and then left for Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Falconetti had suffered from mental illness all her life, and in 1946 she died in Brazil, allegedly due to a self-imposed restrictive diet after having become significantly overweight.  Her remains are interred at Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. Her grandson Gérard Falconetti also became an actor.\")])])])\n}]}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/vue-loader/lib/template-compiler.js?id=data-v-28f9a7e1!./~/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=template&index=0!./src/views/people/Falconetti.vue\n// module id = 101\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports={render:function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"paper paper--list\"\n  }, [_c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"paper__half\"\n  }, [_c('p', [_vm._v(\"\\n            Осуществлены последние изменения \"), _c('router-link', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"to\": \"/events/kinetoscope/ru\"\n    }\n  }, [_vm._v(\"Кинетоскопа\")]), _vm._v(\",\\n            включая использование подъёмных механизмов и более \\n            широких экранов.

Hofer began casting Weixler in a number of comedies presenting her as a comedic, temperamental, independent-minded but endearing teenager, often replete in her soon-to-be signature sailor outfit. She often appeared opposite popular German actor and director Ernst Lubitsch and matinee idol Bruno Kastner in her early films with Hofer.[4] Weixler made approximately eleven films with Hofer, and her role as a brassy teen became popular with German filmgoers.\\nIn 1915 she moved to Oliver Film, but her image was not tampered with significantly. A number of “Dorrit” films were released from 1915 to 1916 which followed her adventures, such as: Dorrit’s Chauffeur (1915), Dorrits Eheglück (English: Dorrit’s Marital Bliss) (1916) and Dorrit bekommt ‘ne Lebensstellung (Dorrit Gets a Job for Life) (1916) for directors such as Paul Otto and Paul Heidemann.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Death\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nDuring the end of May 1916, Weixler was at a theater in Nollendorfplatz as part of a “Dorrit Weixler Week”, which was a promotional campaign for the actress.

During a dance routine, Weixler collapsed on stage and the show had to be closed. Various speculations were cast by the press for her ailment, including stress or a neurological disorder. The filming of a new movie had to be aborted because of her poor health after her collapse. Later that year Weixler was given morphine, to which she became addicted. She was placed in a sanatorium in Berlin for rest and recovery. On 30 November 1916, aged 24, she committed suicide by hanging herself. She was buried at the Südwestkirchhof cemetery in Stahnsdorf in December of that year. In 1921, five years after her death, Dorittchens Vergnügungsreise (Dorritchen’s Pleasure Cruise) was released to the German public.

Его отец, Оливер Харви, был ветераном Гражданской войны в США, участником сражения при Энтитеме, а мать, Эмили Норвел, была представительницей старейшей семьи в штате, а среди её предков был капитан Хью Норвел, участвовавший ещё в колониальных войнах в XVIII веке. Норвел был самым младшим из пяти детей в семье, а менее чем через год после его рождения, глава семейства умер.\\nСмерть отца всё же не оставила семью без средств к существованию, так как их мать была успешной владелицей отеля. Будучи ещё мальчишкой, Норвел был отправлен в военную академию в соседний город Милледжвилль, где пробыл до 13 лет. В 1905 году он поступил в методистский колледж в город Янг-Харрис на севере Джорджии, где получил среднее образование. Интереса к получению знаний он не испытывал, зато с юных лет увлекался музыкой и театром. Его мать поддерживала увлечения сына и отправила его в школу-интернат в Атланту, чтобы изучать пение и музыку. Но Норвел часто пропускал занятие и в итоге сбежал из школы и присоединился к странствующей театральной группе. Где-то в 1910 году, в знак уважения к отцу, Норвел прибавил к своему имени имя Оливер, став именоваться Оливер Норвел Харви, а впоследствии и вовсе стал использовать имя отца как собственное.\\nПосле недолгого участия в театральной группе Оливер вернулся в Милледжвилль, где устроился на работу в недавно открывшийся кинотеатр, в котором совмещал обязанности киномеханика, билетёра, менеджера и дворника. Вскоре он стал одержим киноиндустрией и решил, что может намного лучше сыграть в кино, чем это ­­­делают увиденные им актёры. По совету друга в 1913 году он переехал в город Джэксонвилл в штат Флорида, где стал в ночное время петь в водевилях в кабаре и ночных клубах, а днём проводил время на местной киностудии «Lubin Studios».

Наиболее часто он играл толстяков или злодеев в комедийных фильмах, где его крупные габариты лишь дополняли его образы. После не менее плодотворного 1915 года Харди переехал в Нью-Йорк, где стал сниматься на киностудиях «Pathé», «Casino» и «Edison Studios».\\nПо возвращении в Джэксонвилл Харди уже не вернулся на «Lubin», а стал сотрудничать со студиями «Vim» и «King Bee studios».

He appeared with his comedy partner Stan Laurel in 107 short films, feature films, and cameo roles. He was credited with his first film, Outwitting Dad, in 1914. In some of his early works, he was billed as “Babe Hardy”, using his nickname.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Early life and education\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nOliver Hardy was born Norvell Hardy in Harlem, Georgia. His father Oliver was a Confederate veteran who had been wounded at the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862. After his demobilization as a recruiting officer for Company K, 16th Georgia Regiment, the elder Oliver Hardy assisted his father in running the vestiges of the family cotton plantation. He bought a share in a retail business and was elected full-time Tax Collector for Columbia County, Georgia. Norvell’s mother Emily Norvell was the daughter of Thomas Benjamin Norvell and Mary Freeman, descended from Captain Hugh Norvell of Williamsburg, Virginia, who had arrived in Virginia before 1635. Hardy and Norvell had married March 12, 1890; it was the second marriage for the widow Emily, and the third for Oliver. He was of paternal English American descent and maternal Scottish American descent.\\nThe family moved to Madison in 1891, before Norvell’s birth. Emily Hardy owned a house in Harlem, which was either empty or rented out to tenant farmers. Norvell was likely born in Harlem, though some sources say that his birth occurred in Covington, his mother’s home town. His father died less than a year after his birth. Hardy was the youngest of five children. His older brother Sam Hardy died in a drowning accident in the Oconee River. Hardy pulled his brother from the river but was unable to resuscitate him.\\nAs a child, Hardy was sometimes difficult. He was sent to Georgia Military College in Milledgeville as a youngster. He was sent to Young Harris College in north Georgia in the 1905-1906 school year fall semester (September–January) when he was 13. He was in the junior high component of that institution of the time (the equivalent of high school today).\\nHardy had little interest in formal education, although he acquired an early interest in music and theater, possibly from his mother’s tenants. He joined a theatrical group, and later ran away from a boarding school near Atlanta to sing with the group. His mother recognized his talent for singing and sent him to Atlanta to study music and voice with singing teacher Adolf Dahm-Petersen. Hardy skipped some of his lessons to sing in the Alcazar Theater, a cinema, for US$3.50 a week. He subsequently decided to go back to Milledgeville.\\nSometime prior to 1910, Hardy began styling himself «Oliver Norvell Hardy», adding the first name «Oliver» as a tribute to his father. He appeared as «Oliver N. Hardy» in the 1910 U.S. census,[N 1] and he used «Oliver» as his first name in all subsequent legal records, marriage announcements, etc.\\n\\nHardy was initiated into Freemasonry at Solomon Lodge No. 20 in Jacksonville, Florida. His membership is mentioned in the TV interview on an episode of This Is Your Life in 1954. Hardy’s mother wanted him to attend the University of Georgia in the fall of 1912 to study law, but there is no evidence that he did.\\nCareer\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Advertisement with Hardy for A Day at School (1916), part of the Plump & Runt series\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nIn 1910, when a movie theater opened in Hardy’s home town of Milledgeville, he became the projectionist, ticket taker, janitor and manager. He soon became obsessed with the new motion picture industry, and was convinced that he could do a better job than the actors he saw. A friend suggested that he move to Jacksonville, Florida, where some films were being made. In 1913, Hardy did that, working in Jacksonville as a cabaret and vaudeville singer at night, and at the Lubin Manufacturing Company during the day. It was at this time that he met Madelyn Saloshin, a pianist, whom he married on November 17, 1913 in Macon, Georgia.\\nThe next year he made his first movie, Outwitting Dad (1914), for the Lubin studio. He was billed as O. N. Hardy. In his personal life, he was known as «Babe» Hardy, a nickname that he was given by an Italian barber, who would apply talcum powder to Oliver’s cheeks and say, «nice-a-bab-y.» In many of his later films at Lubin, he was billed as «Babe Hardy.» Hardy was a big man at 6’1» tall and weighing up to 300 pounds. His size placed limitations on the roles he could play. He was most often cast as «the heavy» or the villain. He also frequently had roles in comedy shorts, his size complementing the character.\\nBy 1915, Hardy had made 50 short one-reeler films at Lubin. He later moved to New York and made films for the Pathé, Casino and Edison Studios. After returning to Jacksonville, he made films for the Vim Comedy Company. That studio closed after Hardy discovered the owners were stealing from the payroll.[4] He worked for the King Bee studio, which bought Vim. He worked with Bill Ruge, Billy West (a Charlie Chaplin imitator), and comedic actress Ethel Burton Palmer during this time. (Hardy continued playing the «heavy» for West well into the early 1920s, often imitating Eric Campbell to West’s Chaplin.)\\nWith Stan Laurel in The Lucky Dog (1921), long before they became a team.\\nIn 1917 Hardy moved to Los Angeles, working freelance for several Hollywood studios. Between 1918 and 1923, Hardy made more than 40 films for Vitagraph, mostly playing the «heavy» for Larry Semon. In 1919, he separated from his wife, ending with a provisional divorce in November 1920, which was finalized on November 17, 1921. On November 24, 1921, Hardy married again, to actress Myrtle Reeves. This marriage was also unhappy. Reeves was said to have become alcoholic.\\nIn 1921, he appeared in the movie The Lucky Dog, produced by G.M. («Broncho Billy») Anderson and starring a young British comedian named Stan Laurel.[5] Oliver Hardy played the part of a robber, trying to stick up Stan’s character. They did not work together again for several years. In 1924, Hardy began working at Hal Roach Studios with the Our Gang films and Charley Chase. In 1925, he starred as the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz. Also that year he was in the film, Yes, Yes, Nanette!, starring Jimmy Finlayson and directed by Stan Laurel. (In later years Finlayson frequently was a supporting actor in the Laurel and Hardy film series.) He also continued playing supporting roles in films featuring Clyde Cooke and Bobby Ray.\\n\\nIn 1926, Hardy was scheduled to appear in Get ‘Em Young. He was unexpectedly hospitalized after being burned by a hot leg of lamb. Laurel, who had been working as a gag man and director at Roach Studios, was recruited to fill in.  Laurel continued to act and, later that year, appeared in the same movie as Hardy, 45 Minutes from Hollywood, although they did not share any scenes together.\\nMovie poster of Another Fine Mess (1930)\\nIn 1927, Laurel and Hardy began sharing screen time together in Slipping Wives, Duck Soup (no relation to the 1933 Marx Brothers’ film of the same name) and With Love and Hisses. Roach Studios’ supervising director Leo McCarey, realizing the audience reaction to the two, began intentionally teaming them together. This led to the start of a Laurel and Hardy series later that year.\\nThey began producing a huge body of short movies, including The Battle of the Century (1927) (with one of the largest pie fights ever filmed), Should Married Men Go Home? (1928), Two Tars (1928), Unaccustomed As We Are (1929, marking their transition to talking pictures) Berth Marks (1929), Blotto (1930), Brats (1930) (with Stan and Ollie portraying themselves, as well as their own «sons», using oversized furniture sets for the «young» Laurel and Hardy); Another Fine Mess (1930), Be Big! (1931), and many others.\\nIn 1929, they appeared in their first feature, in one of the revue sequences of Hollywood Revue of 1929, and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in a lavish all-color (in Technicolor) musical feature entitled The Rogue Song. This film marked their first appearance in color, yet only a few fragments of this film survive. In 1931, they starred in their first full-length movie, Pardon Us; they continued to make features and shorts until 1935. The Music Box, a 1932 short, won them an Academy Award for best short film — their only such award.\\nLaurel and Hardy in The Flying Deuces (1939)\\nIn 1936, Hardy and Myrtle Reeves divorced. In 1939, while waiting for a contractual issue between Laurel and Hal Roach to be resolved, Hardy made Zenobia with Harry Langdon. Eventually, however, new contracts were agreed upon and the team was loaned out to producer Boris Morros at General Service Studios to make The Flying Deuces (1939). While on the lot, Hardy fell in love with Virginia Lucille Jones, a script girl, whom he married the next year. They enjoyed a happy marriage until his death.\\nIn 1939, Laurel and Hardy made A Chump at Oxford (1940) (which features a moment of role reversal, with Oliver becoming a subordinate to a temporarily concussed Stan) and Saps at Sea (1940) before leaving Roach Studios. They began performing for the USO, supporting the Allied troops during World War II. They teamed up to make films for 20th Century Fox and later Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Although they made more money at the bigger studios, they had very little artistic control; critics say that these films lack the very qualities that had made Laurel and Hardy worldwide names. Their last Fox feature was The Bullfighters (1945), after which they declined to extend their contract with the studio.\\nIn 1947, Laurel and Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom. Initially unsure of how they would be received, they were mobbed wherever they went. The tour was lengthened to include engagements in Scandinavia, Belgium, France, as well as a Royal Command Performance for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Biographer John McCabe said they continued to make live appearances in the United Kingdom and France for the next several years, until 1954, often using new sketches and material that Laurel had written for them.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Oliver Hardy in The Fighting Kentuckian (1949)\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nIn 1949, Hardy’s friend, John Wayne, asked him to play a supporting role in The Fighting Kentuckian. Hardy had previously worked with Wayne and John Ford in a charity production of the play What Price Glory? while Laurel began treatment for his diabetes a few years previously. Initially hesitant, Hardy accepted the role at the insistence of his comedy partner. Frank Capra later invited Hardy to play a cameo role in Riding High with Bing Crosby in 1950.\\nDuring 1950–51, Laurel and Hardy made their final film. Atoll K (also known as Utopia) was a simple concept; Laurel inherits an island, and the boys set out to sea, where they encounter a storm and discover a brand new island, rich in uranium, making them powerful and wealthy. However, the film was produced by a consortium of European interests, with an international cast and crew that could not speak to each other.[8] In addition, the script needed to be rewritten by Laurel to make it fit the comedy team’s style, and both suffered serious physical illness during the filming.\\nOliver Hardy, along with Stan Laurel, made two live television appearances: In 1953, on a live BBC television broadcast of the popular show «Face the Music» with host Henry Hall and in December 1954, on NBC’s This Is Your Life. They also appeared in a filmed insert for the BBC-TV show This Is Music Hall in 1955, their final public appearance together.\\nParty due to the overwhelmingly positive response to the This Is Your Life telecast, the pair contracted with Hal Roach, Jr., to produce a series of TV shows based on the Mother Goose fables in 1955. According to biographer John McCabe, they were to be filmed in color for NBC, but the series was postponed when Laurel suffered a stroke and required a lengthy convalescence.

During 1956, he began looking after his health for the first time in his life. He lost more than 150 pounds in a few months, which completely changed his appearance. Letters written by Laurel refer to Hardy having terminal cancer. Some readers have thought this was the real reason for Hardy’s rapid weight loss. Both men were heavy smokers. Hal Roach said they were a couple of «freight train smoke stacks».\\nHardy suffered a major stroke on September 14, 1956, which left him confined to bed and unable to speak for several months. He remained at home, in the care of his beloved Lucille. He suffered two more strokes in early August 1957, and slipped into a coma from which he never recovered. Hardy died from cerebral thrombosis on August 7, 1957, at the age of 65. [N 2] His cremated remains are located in the Masonic Garden of Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood.

Мать, Шарлотта Хеннесси, происходила из семьи ирландских католиков и зарабатывала на жизнь шитьём. У Глэдис были младшие брат и сестра — Джек и Лотти, — которые впоследствии взяли фамилию из её псевдонима и тоже стали актёрами.

На представлении присутствовали канадские солдаты, призванные в Южную Африку воевать с бурами .\\nСемья Смитов на протяжении шести лет играла в водевилях и дешёвых мелодрамах. Осенью 1901 года они отправились в Буффало и пять лет гастролировали по Америке, работая на различные театральные компании. В 1907 году пятнадцатилетняя Глэдис добилась аудиенции у продюсера Дэвида Беласко и получила второстепенную роль в пьесе «Уоррены из Вирджинии»  с гонораром в 25 долларов в неделю. По настоянию Беласко она изменила своё достаточно тривиальное имя на псевдоним — Мэри Пикфорд  — и 3 декабря дебютировала на Бродвее. Автором пьесы был Вильям ДеМилль, брат которого Сесил Б.

Она считала кинематограф менее значимым искусством, нежели театр, но тем не менее в начале 1909 года обратилась на киностудию Biograph Studios. Режиссёр Д. У. Гриффит устроил девушке пробы и, так как их результаты удовлетворили его, в тот же день снял её в короткометражке. Мэри, которая с самого начала карьеры проявляла деловую хватку, настояла на гонораре в 10 долларов в день, и Гриффит согласился (при том, что обычно платил актёрам вдвое меньшую сумму). В 1909 году он снял актрису более чем в 50 фильмах. Это было обусловлено тем фактом, что производство на заре кинематографа отнимало немного времени — фильмы, занимавшие одну бобину киноплёнки, длились не более 12 минут и зачастую снимались практически без сценария.\\nСемнадцатилетняя Пикфорд в одном из своих первых фильмов — драме «Одинокая вилла» (1909) с хронометражем всего в 8 минут\\nВ январе 1910 года Гриффит перевёз свою труппу из Нью-Йорка в Лос-Анджелес. Тогда многие кинокомпании проводили зиму на юге западного побережья, так как на северо-восточном светлое время суток становилось короче, и это затрудняло съёмочный процесс. Хотя основной причиной переезда была возможность не платить за грабительские патенты производителей съёмочной техники. Мэри продолжала активно работать, и, хотя в то время на Biograph Studios ещё не существовало титров с перечислением актёров, публика запомнила её, прозвав девочкой с золотыми кудряшками.\\nВ декабре 1910 года Мэри покинула Гриффита и перешла на киностудию Томаса Х. Инса IMP Company, подписав контракт с гонораром в 175 долларов в неделю. Однако качество фильмов (всего более тридцати), снятых на IMP, разочаровало её, и актриса обратилась в суд с требованием разорвать контракт. Выиграв дело, она стала работать на Majestic Film Corp. с ещё большим гонораром в 225 долларов в неделю. Несмотря на то, что кинокомпания приняла в штат в качестве режиссёра её супруга, — актёра Оуэна Мура, за которого Пикфорд вышла в начале года, — их сотрудничество не задалось, и в 1912 году актриса вернулась к Гриффиту. К тому времени она стала широко известна. Пресса все чаще упоминала имя маленькой Мэри  и анонсировала ленты с её участием. Пикфорд завоевала любовь публики благодаря тому, что её игра отличалась интимностью исполнения: актриса выражала эмоции взглядом, а не экспрессивными жестами , и, как писали газеты, вкладывала в игру всё сердце и душу.\\nВ январе 1913 года Пикфорд вернулась на сцену, сыграв в спектакле Беласко под названием «Хорошенький дьяволёнок» (небольшая роль в нём была отведена Лиллиан Гиш, восходящей звезде немого кино). Беласко согласился платить актрисе 250 долларов в неделю, что в 10 раз превышало её гонорар шестилетней давности. Затем продюсер Адольф Цукор предложил Пикфорд экранизировать пьесу. Она согласилась и подписала контракт с его кинокомпанией Famous Players, на этот раз покинув Гриффита окончательно. В 1914 году вышло семь полнометражных фильмов с участием Пикфорд (у Гриффита она снималась только в короткометражках), и в том числе мелодрама «Тэсс из Страны бурь». Роль дочери сквоттера стала поворотным моментом её карьеры. С тех пор кинопоказы фильмов Пикфорд стали сопровождаться такими аншлагами, что газеты советовали зрителям занимать места пораньше, дабы избежать давки .\\nСотрудничество Пикфорд и Цукора сложилось невероятно успешно. Появившись за четыре года в двух десятках полнометражных фильмов, актриса превратилась в объект фанатичного обожания публики и настоящую кинозвезду — божественную куколку, воспеваемую поклонниками в стихах . Вслед за популярностью росли и гонорары: к 1916 году Мэри получала 2 тысячи долларов в неделю и половину прибыли от проката.\\nВ тот же период окончательно сложилось её актёрское амплуа, в котором она задержалась на долгие годы. Миловидная внешность Пикфорд — миниатюрное сложение и нежное лицо, обрамлённое завитыми локонами — идеально подходила к типажам её героинь. Преимущественно ими были обездоленные сироты, девочки-подростки бедного происхождения, несправедливо обиженные жизнью девушки. Эти персонажи находили отклик в сердцах публики, вызывая сочувствие и расположение.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"На вершине славы\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nЗа пределами съёмочной площадки Пикфорд была не настолько беспомощна, как её героини, и отличалась незаурядными деловыми качествами. В 1916 году она основала собственную кинокомпанию Mary Pickford Company, которая несколько лет функционировала под патронажем Famous Players, и получила почти исключительные права на свои фильмы. Она могла отбирать для себя роли, выбирать по своему усмотрению режиссёров и актёров второго плана, утверждать рекламные кампании своих фильмов и высказывать мнение относительно монтажа. Эта договорённость позволила Пикфорд собрать съёмочную группу, с которой ей было комфортно работать. В частности она наняла режиссёра Маршалла Нилана и оператора Чарльза Рошера, которые были заняты соответственно на восьми и восемнадцати картинах актрисы. Сумма её гонорара поднялась до 10 тысяч долларов в неделю , плюс Пикфорд сохраняла право на половину прибыли от проката.\\nИз года в год популярность актрисы продолжала расти. Её наиболее кассовыми картинами 1917 и 1918 годов были «Гордость клана» (на одном из сеансов произошло такое столпотворение, что зрители вышибли дверь в кинотеатр) , «Маленькая принцесса», «Звезда морей», «Ребекка с фермы Саннибрук» и «Бедная маленькая богатая девочка». Автором сценариев последних двух лент была Фрэнсис Марион — открытая Пикфорд, она впоследствии написала около полутора десятков сценариев к картинам актрисы и в 1921 году срежиссировала драму с её участием под названием «Свет любви». Героинями Мэри по-прежнему становились девочки-подростки, однако в некоторых картинах — например, в анти-военном фильме «Маленькая американка» и комедии «Вербовка Джоанны» — она играла вполне взрослых девушек.\\nВ 1918 году актриса подписала контракт с First National, обязавшись сняться в трёх картинах с фиксированным гонораром в 675 тысяч долларов — около 10 миллионов долларов в пересчёте по современному курсу. Этими фильмами, производство которых от стадии сценария до финального монтажа она по-прежнему была вправе контролировать, стали «Длинноногий папочка», «Хулиганка» и «Сердце холмов» (вышли в прокат в 1919 году).\\nВ начале 1919 года Пикфорд, Дуглас Фэрбенкс, Чарли Чаплин и Д. У. Гриффит, объединившись, создали собственную кинокомпанию United Artists, которая занималась исключительно прокатом фильмов. Решение основать собственную компанию-дистрибутор было обусловлено стремлением сломать бытовавшую в то время в Голливуде вертикальную схему работы — крупные студии не только контролировали производство фильмов, но и распространение, отдавая их в прокат в сети собственных кинотеатров.\\nБудучи соучредителем United Artists и продюсером своих фильмов, Пикфорд превратилась в одну из самых влиятельных женщин, когда-либо работавших в киноиндустрии. Первоначально по условиям контракта актриса, равно как и остальные сооснователи, обязалась выпускать по пять фильмов в год. Однако вскоре от этой договоренности пришлось отказаться: производство становилось все более дорогостоящим и длительным процессом. В 1920 году вышло всего две ленты с участием Пикфорд, в 1921 году — три, а затем она окончательно снизила темп и стала выпускать по одному фильму в год.\\nПервым фильмом Мэри по контракту с United Artists стала трагикомедия «Поллианна», снятая по роману Элеоноры Портер. Эта история о кроткой и добродетельной девочке-сироте пользовалась шумным успехом у публики и собрала в мировом прокате более миллиона долларов . Примечательно, что исключительная добросердечность Поллианны угнетала Пикфорд, которая к тому времени уже начинала уставать от светлых, но достаточно однообразных характеров своих героинь . Общество, впрочем, тогда только приветствовало назидательные сюжеты в кинематографе, а реклама «Поллианны» открыто сообщала, что героиня Пикфорд научит любого, как озарить светом свою жизнь и жизни других .\\nДалее, после трагикомедии «Мыльная пена», где Мэри сыграла мечтательную прачку-замарашку, последовали драма «Свет любви», комедия «С чёрного хода» и экранизация повести Фрэнсис Барнетт «Маленький лорд Фаунтлерой». Последнему фильму (его вторым режиссёром был брат актрисы Джек Пикфорд) сопутствовали большие сборы в прокате , более того — картина добралась и до послереволюционной России, где была выпущена под названием «Два претендента». В «Маленьком лорде Фаунтлерое» Пикфорд исполнила сразу две роли — юного наследника Седрика Эррола и его матери.\\nВ 1922 году актриса снялась в ремейке собственного хита восьмилетней давности, мелодраме «Тэсс из Страны бурь». Далее она решила рискнуть и реализовать своё давнее желание вырваться из детского амплуа — Пикфорд достигла тридцатилетнего возраста и устала играть викторианских девочек-подростков, кроме того, этот образ постепенно начал выходить из моды . В 1923 году она пригласила к сотрудничеству немецкого режиссёра Эрнста Любича и снялась в его первом американском фильме, мелодраме «Розита». Её героиня, уличная певица Розита, испытавшая на себе бремя любви короля Испании, представляла собой по-настоящему взрослую женщину, но, к сожалению — несмотря на роскошные декорации и прекрасную прессу, которая провозгласила картину очередным триумфом актрисы , — фильм пользовался меньшим успехом, нежели её предыдущие работы.\\nПоняв, что публика отказывается воспринимать её во взрослом облике, Пикфорд вернулась к былому амплуа. В выпущенном в 1924 году историческом фильме «Дороти Вернон из Хэддон-Холла» она сыграла молодую девушку, в трагикомедии «Маленькая Анни Руни» (1925) — двенадцатилетнюю девочку-сорванца, в драме «Воробушки» (1926) — сироту-подростка. Но тем не менее в следующем 1927 году актрисе исполнилось 35 лет, и она сыграла взрослую роль в мелодраме «Моя любимая девушка».\\nВ марте 1928 года от рака груди умерла мать Пикфорд, и актриса тяжело переживала её смерть. В том же году она решила окончательно порвать с детским имиджем и остригла свои прославленные золотые локоны. При этом событии присутствовали журналисты, и фотографии Пикфорд из парикмахерского салона попали на первые полосы газет.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Закат карьеры\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nВ 1929 году в свои права начинала вступать эпоха звукового кино, и Пикфорд, разумеется, не могла игнорировать этот факт. Она приобрела права на экранизацию пьесы 1927 года под названием «Кокетка» — это была трагическая история о красавице Норме Безант и её возлюбленном, которого застрелил её отец. Оператором фильма должен был стать давний друг актрисы Чарльз Рошер, однако Пикфорд уволила его, когда тот прервал на середине её сцену. Рошер решил вмешаться в процесс по причине того, что на лицо актрисы легла тень, но тем не менее Пикфорд назначила оператором другого человека . Публика в конечном итоге с восторгом приняла «Кокетку» , а Пикфорд получила за роль Нормы своего первого и единственного «Оскара». Критики, однако, отнеслись к фильму более прохладно .\\nВ 1929 году Пикфорд выпустила ещё один фильм — комедию «Укрощение строптивой» по одноимённому произведению Шекспира, где появилась в паре со своим вторым мужем Дугласом Фэрбенксом. Затем в 1930 году начала производство картины «Твоя навечно», однако из-за пристрастия к алкоголю режиссёра Маршалла Нилана заморозила проект и уничтожила отснятые материалы. Следующая картина Пикфорд, мюзикл «Кики» по мотивам пьесы Беласко, вышла в 1931 году и провалилась в прокате, возместив только половину затраченного бюджета.\\nЕё следующая картина — вестерн 1933 года «Секреты» — тоже не имела кассового успеха.

В 1918 году, когда шла Первая мировая война, актриса совместно с Дугласом Фэрбенксом, Чарли Чаплином и Мэри Дресслер  посетила с публичными выступлениями несколько городов, призывая граждан покупать облигации военного займа — доход от них шёл на финансирование военных нужд.\\nКогда Пикфорд выступала на Wall Street, её аудитория составила около 50 тысяч человек — несмотря на своё канадское происхождение, она превратилась в один из главных символов Америки тех лет, и благодаря её усилиям в поддержку армии была собрана значительная сумма. Кроме того, совместно с Монти Блю и Джоан Марш она выпустила агитационную короткометражку «Стопроцентные американцы». В то время Пикфорд была очень популярна в армии: в её честь были названы две пушки, 143-й артиллерийский полк носил неофициальное название «Барашки Мэри» , а сама она в феврале 1918 года была возведена в ранг почётного полковника и присутствовала на военных парадах .\\nВ 1921 году Пикфорд совместно с Фэрбенксом, Чаплином и Гриффитом организовала Фонд помощи нуждающимся киноактёрам (функционирует до сих пор) и стала его вице-президентом. Чтобы собрать средства, устроителями проводились благотворительные балы и киносеансы, спортивные мероприятия, показы мод и др. В 1932 году по инициативе Пикфорд фонд обратился к деятелям киноиндустрии, заработок которых превышал 200 долларов в неделю, с просьбой перечислять полпроцента или один процент от своего гонорара в пользу их менее удачливых коллег. \\nВ 1927 году Пикфорд была в составе влиятельных голливудских лиц, основавших Американскую академию киноискусства. Её соучредителями являлись актёры Дуглас Фэрбенкс и Гарольд Ллойд, режиссёры Фред Нибло и Рауль Уолш, продюсеры Джек Уорнер и Ирвинг Тальберг, а также другие деятели, составлявшие цвет американского кинематографа тех лет.\\nЗатем в 1941 году, уже перестав сниматься в кино, Пикфорд предприняла вторую попытку ослабить влияние крупных студий (в то время монополия на производство и прокат фильмов почти целиком принадлежала MGM, Paramount Pictures, RKO, Warner Bros. и 20th Century Fox) и совместно с Уолтом Диснеем, Орсоном Уэллсом, Чарли Чаплином и другими основала Объединение независимых кинопродюсеров (функционировало до 1958 года).\\nВ 1944 году Мэри стала председателем женского отделения основанного Рузвельтом Национального фонда борьбы с полиомиелитом и посещала госпитали, где лежали больные дети. В 1949 году вместе со своим третьим мужем Чарльзом Роджерсом и другом Малкольмом Бойдом она основала телерадиокомпанию Pickford-Rogers-Boyd.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Личная жизнь\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nАктриса трижды была замужем. 7 января 1911 года восемнадцатилетняя Пикфорд вышла замуж за Оуэна Мура, актёра ирландского происхождения, в дуэте с которым часто снималась. Её мать, которая на протяжении многих лет имела большое влияние на Мэри, не разделяла симпатию дочери к Муру, поэтому некоторое время супруги скрывали от неё свои отношения. Их брак оказался неудачным из-за алкоголизма Мура и его неприятия популярности супруги. Начиная с 1914 года они жили раздельно, а затем Пикфорд завязала роман с Дугласом Фэрбенксом — в то время он выступал на Бродвее и вскоре стал столь же знаменит в кино, как и Мэри.\\nНекоторое время они хранили свою связь в секрете от окружающих. Так как Фэрбенкс был женат, Пикфорд опасалась, что огласка приведет к скандалу, и не хотела портить свою безупречную репутацию. Однако они появлялись вместе на публике во время благотворительных туров 1918 года. 2 марта 1920 года Пикфорд наконец развелась с Муром, и в прессе начали циркулировать слухи о её возможном браке с Фэрбенксом. Несмотря на то, что актриса заявила о беспочвенности подобных слухов , 28 марта она всё-таки вышла за Фэрбенкса (актёр стал свободен ещё в ноябре 1919 года).\\nЦеремония прошла в закрытом кругу — не были приглашены даже их близкие друзья, включая Чаплина, — а свидетелями выступили сводный брат жениха Джон Фэрбенкс и актриса Марджори Доу . 19 мая 1920 года молодожёны отплыли на пароходе Royal George в Европу и провели там всё лето . Осенью 1920 года, вскоре после того, как они вернулись в Америку, имя Пикфорд оказалось косвенно вовлечено в скандал, когда 10 сентября жена её брата Джека, актриса Олив Томас, скончалась во Франции, случайно выпив раствор сулемы (этим лекарством её супруг пытался вылечиться от хронического сифилиса).\\nПосле медового месяца звёздная чета поселились вместе в огромном поместье Фэрбенкса неподалеку от Лос-Анджелеса, которое получило название от слияния их имен — Пикфэр. На протяжении 20-х годов Пикфорд и Фэрбенкс составляли самую известную супружескую пару Голливуда. На проводимых в их поместье приёмах собирался цвет артистического, политического и интеллектуального сообществ тех лет. В 1927 году они стали первыми актёрами, которые оставили отпечатки своих ладоней на цементной плите перед входом в кинотеатр Grauman’s Chinese Theate. Слава сопутствовала актёрам по всему миру — и в том числе в СССР.\\nЛетом 1926 года Пикфорд и Фэрбенкс побывали в Советском Союзе, где затем была выпущена книга «Они у нас. Мери Пикфорд и Дуглас Фербенкс в СССР» . Также в 1927 году вышел фильм Сергея Комарова «Поцелуй Мэри Пикфорд». Его производство было само по себе курьёзом: документальные кадры из хроники пребывания актёров на Украине (в частности эпизод, где Мэри поцеловала одного из поклонников) были смонтированы с отснятым уже после их отъезда материалом. В итоге получилась комедия о простом парне Гоге, которому не везёт в любви, но после поцелуя звезды дамы начинают обращать на него внимание. Пикфорд узнала о существовании этого фильма только в конце жизни.\\nОднако и этот брак актрисы в итоге распался. Из-за плотного съёмочного графика супруги проводили друг с другом немного времени. Помимо этого Фэрбенкс любил путешествовать и начиная с 1930 года уезжал в одиночку, оставляя жену дома. В начале 30-х он увлёкся британской актрисой леди Сильвией Эшли, и этот роман подвёл черту под его браком с Пикфорд. Они стали жить раздельно и развелись 10 января 1936 года. В марте 1936 года Фэрбенкс женился на Эшли. Пикфорд тоже недолго оставалась одна. 24 июня 1937 года она вышла замуж за актёра и джазового музыканта Чарльза «Бадди» Роджерса (своего партнёра в фильме 1927 года «Моя любимая девушка»), но тем не менее сохранила привязанность к Фэрбенксу и, когда в 1939 году он скончался от сердечного приступа, глубоко переживала утрату . В 1943 и 1944 годах Пикфорд и Роджерс усыновили соответственно мальчика Рональда Чарльза и девочку Роксанну.

На протяжении 1940-х годов она занималась продюсированием фильмов, выпустив, среди прочих, драму «Спи, моя любовь» (1948) с Клодет Кольбер и комедию «Счастливая любовь» (1949) с братьями Маркс. Её частная жизнь, между тем, была далека от благополучия. За несколько лет она потеряла одного за другим всех своих близких родственников. В 1928 году умерла её мать, в 1933 — брат Джек, в 1936 — сестра Лотти. Болезненное расставание с Фэрбенксом тоже способствовало развитию депрессии, и актриса пристрастилась к алкоголю.\\nЕё приемные дети, повзрослев, рано ушли из дома. Со временем Пикфорд стала вести очень уединённую жизнь и редко покидала Пикфэр, позволяя навещать себя только Лиллиан Гиш, своему пасынку Дугласу Фэрбенксу-младшему и некоторым близким друзьям. В середине 1960-х годов она общалась с внешним миром по телефону, не выходя из спальни. В 1976 году Пикфорд наградили почётным «Оскаром» за вклад в развитие кинематографа, и съёмочная группа, направленная в Пикфэр, запечатлела короткое благодарственное выступление актрисы.\\nНезадолго до смерти Пикфорд обратилась к правительству Канады с просьбой восстановить её гражданство, которое, как она считала, было утеряно после брака с Фэрбенксом, американским гражданином. Канада удовлетворила просьбу знаменитой соотечественницы, и таким образом на закате жизни у неё появилось двойное гражданство. Мэри Пикфорд — любимица Америки, когда-то обожаемая миллионами — скончалась от кровоизлияния в мозг 29 мая 1979 года в возрасте восьмидесяти семи лет. Она была похоронена на кладбище мемориального парка Форест-Лаун в Калифорнии на том же участке, где покоились её мать, брат и сестра.\")])]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"paper__half\"\n  }, [_c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Gladys Louise Smith\")]), _vm._v(\" (April 8, 1892 – May 29, 1979), known professionally as Mary Pickford, was a Canadian-American film actress, writer, director, and producer. She was a co-founder of the film studio United Artists and one of the original 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. \\nKnown in her prime as “America’s Sweetheart”   and the “girl with the curls”,  Pickford was one of the Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood and a significant figure in the development of film acting. Pickford was one of the earliest stars to be billed under her name (film performers up until that time were usually unbilled), and was one of the most popular actresses of the 1910s and ‘20s, earning the nickname “Queen of the Movies”.\\nShe was awarded the second ever Academy Award for Best Actress for her first sound film role in Coquette (1929) and also received an honorary Academy Award in 1976. In consideration of her contributions to American cinema, the American Film Institute ranked Pickford as 24th in its 1999 list of greatest female stars of classic Hollywood Cinema.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Early life\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nMary Pickford was born Gladys Louise Smith in 1892 (although she would later claim 1893 or 1894 as her year of birth) at 211 University Avenue,A Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Her father, John Charles Smith, was the son of English Methodist immigrants, and worked a variety of odd jobs. Her mother, Charlotte Hennessey, was of Irish Catholic descent and worked for a time as a seamstress. She had two younger siblings, Charlotte, called “Lottie” (born 1893), and John Charles, called “Jack” (born 1896), who also became actors. To please her husband’s relatives, Pickford’s mother baptized her children as Methodists, the faith of their father. John Charles Smith was an alcoholic; he abandoned the family and died on February 11, 1898, from a fatal blood clot caused by a workplace accident when he was a purser with Niagara Steamship. \\nWhen Gladys was age four, her household was under infectious quarantine, a public health measure. Their devoutly Catholic maternal grandmother (Catherine Faeley Hennessey) asked a visiting Roman Catholic priest to baptize the children. Pickford was at this time baptized as Gladys Marie Smith. \\nCharlotte Smith began taking in boarders after being widowed. One of these was a theatrical stage manager. At his suggestion, Gladys (age 7) was given two small roles, one as a boy and the other as a girl,  in a stock company production of The Silver King at Toronto’s Princess Theatre. She subsequently acted in many melodramas with Toronto’s Valentine Company, finally playing the major child role in their version of The Silver King. She capped her short career in Toronto with the starring role of Little Eva in their production of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, adapted from the 1852 novel by American writer and abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe.\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Career\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nBy the early 1900s, theatre had become a family enterprise. Gladys, her mother and two younger siblings toured the United States by rail, performing in third-rate companies and plays. After six impoverished years, Pickford allowed one more summer to land a leading role on Broadway, planning to quit acting if she failed. In 1906 Gladys, Lottie and Jack Smith supported singer Chauncey Olcott on Broadway in Edmund Burke.  Gladys finally landed a supporting role in a 1907 Broadway play, The Warrens of Virginia. The play was written by William C. deMille, whose brother, Cecil, appeared in the cast. David Belasco, the producer of the play, insisted that Gladys Smith assume the stage name Mary Pickford.  After completing the Broadway run and touring the play, however, Pickford was again out of work.\\nOn April 19, 1909, the Biograph Company director D. W. Griffith screen-tested her at the company’s New York studio for a role in the nickelodeon film, Pippa Passes. The role went to someone else but Griffith was immediately taken with Pickford. She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day. Most Biograph actors earned $5 a day but, after Pickford’s single day in the studio, Griffith agreed to pay her $10 a day against a guarantee of $40 a week. \\nPickford, like all actors at Biograph, played both bit parts and leading roles, including mothers, ingenues, charwomen, spitfires, slaves, Native Americans, spurned women, and a prostitute. As Pickford said of her success at Biograph: “I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I’d become known, and there would be a demand for my work.”\\nShe appeared in 51 films in 1909 – almost one a week. She also introduced her friend Florence La Badie to D. W. Griffith, who launched La Badie’s career. \\nIn January 1910, Pickford traveled with a Biograph crew to Los Angeles. Many other film companies wintered on the West Coast, escaping the weak light and short days that hampered winter shooting in the East. Pickford added to her 1909 Biographs (Sweet and Twenty, They Would Elope, and To Save Her Soul, to name a few) with films made in California.\\nActors were not listed in the credits in Griffith’s company. Audiences noticed and identified Pickford within weeks of her first film appearance. Exhibitors in turn capitalized on her popularity by advertising on sandwich boards that a film featuring “The Girl with the Golden Curls”, “Blondilocks”, or “The Biograph Girl” was inside. \\nPickford left Biograph in December 1910. The following year, she starred in films at Carl Laemmle’s Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP). IMP was absorbed into Universal Pictures in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford returned to work with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances were in his films, such as Friends, The Mender of Nets, Just Like a Woman, and The Female of the Species. That year Pickford also introduced Dorothy and Lillian Gish (both friends from her days in touring melodrama) to Griffith.  Both became major silent stars, in comedy and tragedy, respectively. Pickford made her last Biograph picture, The New York Hat, in late 1912.\\nShe returned to Broadway in the David Belasco production of A Good Little Devil (1912). This was a major turning point in her career. Pickford, who had always hoped to conquer the Broadway stage, discovered how deeply she missed film acting. In 1913, she decided to work exclusively in film. The previous year, Adolph Zukor had formed Famous Players in Famous Plays. It was later known as Famous Players-Lasky and then Paramount Pictures, one of the first American feature film companies.\\nPickford left the stage to join Zukor’s roster of stars. Zukor believed film’s potential lay in recording theatrical players in replicas of their most famous stage roles and productions. Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of A Good Little Devil. The film, produced in 1913, showed the play’s Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called “one of the worst [features] I ever made ... it was deadly”.  Zukor agreed; he held the film back from distribution for a year.\\nPickford’s work in material written for the camera by that time had attracted a strong following. Comedy-dramas, such as In the Bishop’s Carriage (1913), Caprice (1913), and especially Hearts Adrift (1914), made her irresistible to moviegoers. Hearts Adrift was so popular that Pickford asked for the first of her many publicized pay raises based on the profits and reviews.  The film marked the first time Pickford’s name was featured above the title on movie marquees.  Tess of the Storm Country was released five weeks later. Biographer Kevin Brownlow observed that the film “sent her career into orbit and made her the most popular actress in America, if not the world”. \\nHer appeal was summed up two years later by the February 1916 issue of Photoplay as “luminous tenderness in a steel band of gutter ferocity”.  Only Charlie Chaplin, who reportedly slightly surpassed Pickford’s popularity in 1916,  had a similarly spellbinding pull with critics and the audience. Each enjoyed a level of fame far exceeding that of other actors. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Pickford was believed to be the most famous woman in the world, or, as a silent-film journalist described her, “the best known woman who has ever lived, the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history.”\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Stardom\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nPickford starred in 52 features throughout her career. On June 24, 1916, Pickford signed a new contract with Zukor that granted her full authority over production of the films in which she starred,  and a record-breaking salary of $10,000 a week.  In addition, Pickford’s compensation was half of a film’s profits, with a guarantee of $1,040,000 (US$ 17,150,000 in 2016). Occasionally, she played a child, in films such as The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917), Daddy-Long-Legs (1919) and Pollyanna (1920). Pickford’s fans were devoted to these “Little Girl” roles, but they were not typical of her career. \\nIn August 1918, Pickford’s contract expired and, when refusing Zukor’s terms for a renewal, she was offered $250,000 to leave the motion picture business. She declined, and went to First National Pictures, which agreed to her terms.  In 1919, Pickford, along with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks, formed the independent film production company United Artists. Through United Artists, Pickford continued to produce and perform in her own movies; she could also distribute them as she chose. In 1920, Pickford’s film Pollyanna grossed around $1,100,000.  The following year, Pickford’s film Little Lord Fauntleroy was also a success, and in 1923, Rosita grossed over $1,000,000 as well.  During this period, she also made Little Annie Rooney (1925), another film in which Pickford played a child, Sparrows (1926), which blended the Dickensian with newly minted German expressionist style, and My Best Girl (1927), a romantic comedy featuring her future husband Buddy Rogers. \\nThe arrival of sound was her undoing. Pickford underestimated the value of adding sound to movies, claiming that “adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the Venus de Milo”. \\nShe played a reckless socialite in Coquette (1929), a role for which her famous ringlets were cut into a 1920s’ bob. Pickford had already cut her hair in the wake of her mother’s death in 1928. Fans were shocked at the transformation.  Pickford’s hair had become a symbol of female virtue, and when she cut it, the act made front-page news in The New York Times and other papers. Coquette was a success and won her an Academy Award for Best Actress,  although this was highly controversial.  The public failed to respond to her in the more sophisticated roles. Like most movie stars of the silent era, Pickford found her career fading as talkies became more popular among audiences. \\nHer next film, The Taming of The Shrew, made with husband Douglas Fairbanks, was not well received at the box office.  Established Hollywood actors were panicked by the impending arrival of the talkies. On March 29, 1928, The Dodge Brothers Hour was broadcast from Pickford’s bungalow, featuring Fairbanks, Chaplin, Norma Talmadge, Gloria Swanson, John Barrymore, D.W. Griffith, and Dolores del Rio, among others. They spoke on the radio show to prove that they could meet the challenge of talking movies. \\nBut the transition came as Pickford was in her late 30s, no longer able to play the children, teenage spitfires, and feisty young women so adored by her fans, and was not suited for the glamorous and vampish heroines of early sound. In 1933, Pickford underwent a Technicolor screen test for an animated/live action film version of Alice in Wonderland, but Walt Disney discarded the project when Paramount released its own version of the book. Only one Technicolor still of her screen test still exists. She retired from acting in 1933; her last acting film was released in 1934. She continued to produce for others, however, including Sleep, My Love (1948; with Claudette Colbert) and Love Happy (1949), with the Marx Brothers). \")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"The film industry\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nMary Pickford giving President Herbert Hoover a ticket for a film industry benefit for the unemployed, 1931\\nPickford used her stature in the movie industry to promote a variety of causes. Although her image depicted fragility and innocence, Pickford proved to be a worthy businesswoman who took control of her career in a cutthroat industry. \\nDuring World War I, she promoted the sale of Liberty Bonds, making an intensive series of fund-raising speeches that kicked off in Washington, D.C., where she sold bonds alongside Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Theda Bara, and Marie Dressler. Five days later she spoke on Wall Street to an estimated 50,000 people. Though Canadian-born, she was a powerful symbol of Americana, kissing the American flag for cameras and auctioning one of her world-famous curls for $15,000. In a single speech in Chicago she sold an estimated five million dollars’ worth of bonds. She was christened the U.S. Navy’s official “Little Sister”; the Army named two cannons after her and made her an honorary colonel. \\nAt the end of World War I, Pickford conceived of the Motion Picture Relief Fund, an organization to help financially needy actors. Leftover funds from her work selling Liberty Bonds were put toward its creation, and in 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was officially incorporated, with Joseph Schenck voted its first president and Pickford its vice president. In 1932, Pickford spearheaded the “Payroll Pledge Program”, a payroll-deduction plan for studio workers who gave one half of one percent of their earnings to the MPRF. As a result, in 1940, the Fund was able to purchase land and build the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital, in Woodland Hills, California. \\nAn astute businesswoman, Pickford became her own producer within three years of her start in features. According to her Foundation, “she oversaw every aspect of the making of her films, from hiring talent and crew to overseeing the script, the shooting, the editing, to the final release and promotion of each project.” She demanded (and received) these powers in 1916, when she was under contract to Zukor’s Famous Players In Famous Plays (later Paramount). Zukor acquiesced to her refusal to participate in block-booking, the widespread practice of forcing an exhibitor to show a bad film of the studio’s choosing to also be able to show a Pickford film. In 1916, Pickford’s films were distributed, singly, through a special distribution unit called Artcraft. The Mary Pickford Corporation was briefly Pickford’s motion-picture production company. \\nIn 1919, she increased her power by co-founding United Artists (UA) with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her soon-to-be husband, Douglas Fairbanks. Before UA’s creation, Hollywood studios were vertically integrated, not only producing films but forming chains of theaters. Distributors (also part of the studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company’s movie venues. Filmmakers relied on the studios for bookings; in return they put up with what many considered creative interference.\\nUnited Artists broke from this tradition. It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on Santa Monica Boulevard. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford’s acting career had largely faded.  After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists.

She married Owen Moore, an Irish-born silent film actor, on January 7, 1911. It is rumored she became pregnant by Moore in the early 1910s and had a miscarriage or an abortion. Some accounts suggest this resulted in her later inability to have children.  The couple had numerous marital problems, notably Moore’s alcoholism, insecurity about living in the shadow of Pickford’s fame, and bouts of domestic violence. The couple lived together on-and-off for several years. \\nPickford became secretly involved in a relationship with Douglas Fairbanks. They toured the US together in 1918 to promote Liberty Bond sales for the World War I effort. Around this time, Pickford also suffered from the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic, but survived.  Pickford divorced Moore on March 2, 1920, after she agreed to his $100,000 demand for a settlement.  She married Fairbanks just days later on March 28, 1920. They went to Europe for their honeymoon; fans in London and in Paris caused riots trying to get to the famous couple. The couple’s triumphant return to Hollywood was witnessed by vast crowds who turned out to hail them at railway stations across the United States.\\nThe Mark of Zorro (1920) and a series of other swashbucklers gave the popular Fairbanks a more romantic, heroic image. Pickford continued to epitomize the virtuous but fiery girl next door. Even at private parties, people instinctively stood up when Pickford entered a room; she and her husband were often referred to as “Hollywood royalty”. Their international reputations were broad. Foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visited the White House often asked if they could also visit Pickfair, the couple’s mansion in Beverly Hills. \\nDinners at Pickfair included a number of notable guests. Charlie Chaplin, Fairbanks’ best friend, was often present. Other guests included George Bernard Shaw, Albert Einstein, Elinor Glyn, Helen Keller, H. G. Wells, Lord Mountbatten, Fritz Kreisler, Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Noël Coward, Max Reinhardt, Baron Nishi, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko,  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Austen Chamberlain, Sir Harry Lauder, and Meher Baba, among others. The public nature of Pickford’s second marriage strained it to the breaking point. Both she and Fairbanks had little time off from producing and acting in their films. They were also constantly on display as America’s unofficial ambassadors to the world, leading parades, cutting ribbons, and making speeches. When their film careers both began to flounder at the end of the silent era, Fairbanks’ restless nature prompted him to overseas travel (something which Pickford did not enjoy). When Fairbanks’ romance with Sylvia, Lady Ashley became public in the early 1930s, he and Pickford separated. They divorced January 10, 1936. Fairbanks’ son by his first wife, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., claimed his father and Pickford long regretted their inability to reconcile. \\nOn June 24, 1937, Pickford married her third and last husband, actor and band leader Buddy Rogers. They adopted two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). As a PBS American Experience documentary noted, Pickford’s relationship with her children was tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie’s small stature and Roxanne’s crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that “Things didn’t work out that much, you know. But I’ll never forget her. I think that she was a good woman.”\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Later years\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford became an alcoholic, as her father had been. Her mother Charlotte died of breast cancer in March 1928. Her siblings, Lottie and Jack, both died of alcohol-related causes. These deaths, her divorce from Fairbanks, and the end of silent films left Pickford deeply depressed. Her relationship with her children, Roxanne and Ronald, was turbulent at best. Pickford withdrew and gradually became a recluse, remaining almost entirely at Pickfair and allowing visits only from Lillian Gish, her stepson Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and few other people. She appeared in court in 1959, in a matter pertaining to her co-ownership of North Carolina TV station WSJS-TV. The court date coincided with the date of her 67th birthday; under oath, when asked to give her age, Pickford replied, “I’m 21, going on 20”. \\nIn the mid-1960s, Pickford often received visitors only by telephone, speaking to them from her bedroom. Buddy Rogers often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford in the drawing room. A print of this image now hangs in the Library of Congress.  In addition to her Oscar as best actress for Coquette (1929), Mary Pickford received an Academy Honorary Award in 1976 for lifetime achievement. The Academy sent a TV crew to her house to record her short statement of thanks – offering the public a very rare glimpse into Pickfair Manor. \\nPickford had become an American citizen upon her marriage to Fairbanks in 1920.  Toward the end of her life, Pickford made arrangements with the Department of Citizenship to regain her Canadian citizenship because she wished to “die as a Canadian”.

Her family moved to Seattle, Washington when she was 13 years old. Nell started stage acting and joined theatrical stock companies before working in film. From an early age, she developed a respect toward animals and later fought for animal rights in Hollywood speaking out against animal cruelty. She rescued as many as she could accommodate and ultimately ended up with her own zoo containing over 200 animals of all sorts.  When Nell was 18 years old, she met and married 39 year old theatrical impresario, Ernest Shipman (December 17, 1871 – August 7, 1931).\\nAfter marrying, Ernest and Nell moved to Hollywood to start working in the film industry. During this time, Nell sold the rights of her book, Under the Crescent Moon to Universal Studios (they wanted to make a six film serial of the story). Nell also started acting in Universal, Selig & Vitagraph productions. Between 1915–1918, she played several leading roles including her big debut film God’s Country and the Woman (1915). Nell directed, produced, and acted in the film that was based on a James Oliver Curwood short story. She was one of the first directors to shoot her films almost entirely on location. \\nIn 1918, Nell Shipman suffered from Spanish influenza and nearly died. She also lost all of her beautiful thick long hair and was forced to wear a wig. Fortunately her distinctive locks grew back.  During her recovery, she decided to create a production company called “Shipman-Curwood Producing Company”. Through the efforts of Ernest Shipman, who convinced a consortium of Calgary businessmen to invest in the potential of Alberta becoming a major film location destination, a company, Canadian Photoplays Ltd., was incorporated on February 7, 1919, with a $250,000 investment. The first and only film the company would produce was based on another Curwood story, “Wapi the Walrus” and adapted to the screen by Nell herself. The name was changed to Back to God’s Country for no other reason than to capitalize on Nell’s success in God’s Country and the Woman. \\nThe 73-minute film (at 18 frames per second) was shot in Los Angeles, San Francisco and on location near Lesser Slave Lake, Alberta, Canada by director, David M. Hartford. The cameramen were Dal Clawson and Joseph B. Walker, who later gained fame as Hollywood director, Frank Capra’s main cinematographer.  “Back To God’s Country” was a major Canadian and international silent film hit. Nell also played the lead in the film which featured a controversial though very brief nude scene. One of the promotional advertisements for the film had a line drawing of a nude Nell from the back frolicking with several animals. Part of the caption read: “Don’t book Back To God’s Country unless you want to prove the Nude is NOT Rude.” \\nAlthough the movie was extremely successful and brought in a 300% profit, no further investments were forthcoming. As well, Curwood was infuriated with Nell because she changed the scenario of his short story. She adapted the protagonist of the film from the Great Dane, Wapi to the female lead, Delores. Shipman also shaped her character into a heroine: she saved the male lead and in so doing created an independent character and feminist role model. \\nAfter shooting Back to God’s Country, Nell and co-star Bert Van Tuyle, with whom she was having an affair, moved back to Hollywood where she subsequently divorced Ernest Shipman.  During this period, Nell created “Nell Shipman Productions” with Van Tuyle and established herself as an independent producer. She focused on the major themes she enjoyed: wild animals, nature, feminist heroes, and filming on location. She produced, wrote, co-directed and starred in The Girl From God’s Country (1921) and The Grub Stake (1923). Both films were successful. \\nWhile living in Spokane, Washington, Nell Shipman made a film called The Grub Stake, which costs around $180,000 to produce. Unfortunately, the film was never distributed. The American distributor went bankrupt and during subsequent litigation, the film became tied up in the legal proceedings. During this time, Nell tried to maintain her production company and after transporting her entire zoo on barges up to Priest Lake, Idaho, she made several short films at Lion Head Lodge. Unfortunately, life was difficult as Van Tuyle became increasingly unstable and by hostile locals who killed her animals.  In a scenario reminiscent of one of her films, Nell and Bert got lost in the wild for two days during a violent snow storm in early 1924. However, they managed to escape death when they were saved by two brothers, Joseph and Fred Gumaer. \\nLater that same year, Nell ‘s company went bankrupt and she broke up with Van Tuyle.  She was forced to send her animals to the San Diego Zoo because of her inability to pay the maintenance costs. Nell next moved across the country and traveled the world. Eventually, she started writing scripts and short stories. The most notable contribution at this time was the story which became the basis of Wings in the Dark starring Myrna Loy and Cary Grant (1934). Nell finally moved to the California desert and continued writing there for the rest of her life. For the remainder of their respective careers, neither Nell nor Ernest had been able to duplicate the success of Back to God’s Country. Ernest died at the age of 53 due to cirrhosis of the liver. Their son, Barry was an actor and a singer. He married actress, Beulah McDonald, in 1934 and went on to have a successful career as a writer for movies serials, television and feature films. \\nNell Shipman’s Nell’s last major project was her autobiography, The Silent Screen and My Talking Heart, published posthumously by Boise State University through their Hemingway Western Studies Series. The university also houses the Nell Shipman Collection at Albertsons Library. Many of her films were preserved and are available through the library.

Смазывание изображения, наблюдаемого через окуляр на освещённой электролампой киноплёнке, предотвращалось обтюратором с малым углом раскрытия. Эдисон планировал также создать кинетоскоп для просмотра объёмных изображений по аналогии с появившимся стереоскопом, но из-за начавшейся конкуренции с другими устройствами, вскоре отказался от этой идеи. Одним из главных недостатков конструкции, обусловившим индивидуальный способ просмотра, была низкая световая эффективность. Из-за непрерывного движения киноплёнки мимо окуляра, кинетоскоп требовал очень коротких вспышек света для получения хотя бы относительной устойчивости изображения. Это лишало возможности обеспечить достаточную яркость при проекции на экран. Предпринятые после первых успехов аппарата Эдисона многочисленные попытки других изобретателей усовершенствовать его, увенчались появлением «Синематографа» братьев Люмьер, в котором плёнка двигалась прерывисто при помощи грейфера. Акционерное общество «Кинетоскоп» снимало фильмы для своих аппаратов с помощью «Кинетографа», но для просмотра впоследствии оказались пригодны также киноролики, снятые другими устройствами. Формат 35-мм киноплёнки, впервые разработанный Эдисоном для кинетоскопа, быстро стал всеобщим стандартом и позволил осуществлять обмен фильмами, изготовленными различными аппаратами. В момент появления технологии теоретических обоснований частоты съёмки и проекции ещё не существовало, поэтому скорость киноплёнки варьировалась в аппаратах в пределах 30 — 40 кадров в секунду. При просмотре, благодаря инерции зрения, создавалось впечатление движущегося изображения. Ролик киноплёнки «Кодак-Эдисон» стандартной длины 50 футов при частоте показа 40 кадров в секунду имел продолжительность не более 20 секунд. Некоторые фильмы снимались и демонстрировались при пониженной частоте, поскольку киноплёнка большей длины не выпускалась. Считается, что ролик про атлета Сандова из «первой десятки» кинопроката Эдисона был снят со скоростью 16 кадров в секунду, чтобы удлинить время просмотра до 50 секунд.\")])\n},function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Коммерческое использование\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nПатентную заявку на изобретение Эдисон подал 31 июля 1891 года, хотя аппарат ещё находился на стадии лабораторных испытаний и не был готов для серийного производства. Незадолго до этого — 20 мая — в лаборатории состоялась первая публичная демонстрация изготовленного прототипа для 150 участниц Федерации женских клубов США. Показанный ролик впоследствии получил название «Приветствие Диксона». Восторг публики, впервые увидевшей движущиеся фотографии, убедил авторов изобретения в целесообразности его коммерческого использования. В 1892 году было создано «Акционерное общество Кинетоскоп», получившее монополию на распространение аппаратов и технологии на территории США.\\n14 марта 1893 года патент на «Кинетоскоп» был получен и вскоре аппарат экспонировался на выставке в Чикаго. 9 мая состоялась первая демонстрация серийного устройства в Институте Искусства и Науки в Бруклине. Первым фильмом, представленным публике стала «Сцена с кузнецами», снятая в новой студии. Последним штрихом была установка на кинетоскопах автоматического монетоприёмника: так Эдисон, проделавший до этого то же самое с фонографом, оказался одним из изобретателей торговых автоматов. 14 апреля 1894 года коммерсанты братья Холланд открыли на Бродвее «кабину» (англ. Kinetoscope Parlor), в которой были установлены десять кинетоскопов, предназначенных для индивидуального просмотра. Аппараты, установленные по пять штук в два ряда, показывали разные фильмы, и каждый зритель за 25 центов мог посмотреть ролики одного ряда, а за полдоллара — все десять. Кинетоскопы были куплены у лабораторий Эдисона по цене 200 долларов за штуку акционерным обществом во главе с Норманом Раффом и Фрэнком Гаммоном, компаньоном которых стал Эндрю Холланд, один из владельцев кинозала. В первую программу вошли десять фильмов: «Парикмахерская», «Кузнецы», «Петушиный бой», «Подковывание лошади», «Горные танцы», «Трапеция», «Борьба», два ролика о британской акробатке Эне Бертольди и один об упражнениях атлета Сандова. К 1 июня Холланды открыли аналогичные заведения в Чикаго и Сан-Франциско, а 17 октября появился первый зал за пределами США — в Лондоне. В акционерное общество начали вступать десятки новых компаний, желающих распространять аттракцион, приносящий немедленную прибыль. Только за 11 первых месяцев эксплуатации кинетоскопы принесли доход в размере 150 тысяч долларов.\\nУже за полтора года до первой демонстрации фильма Люмьерами на большом экране в парижском «Гран-кафе», Эдисон положил начало кинопрокату, создав целую сеть кинозалов. Кинетоскопы быстро стали популярны у публики, но рассматривание изображения через окуляр не отвечало нынешним представлениям о кинозрелище, подразумевающим одновременный просмотр несколькими зрителями. Кроме того, большинство сюжетов были примитивны и повторяли тематику, общепринятую для зоотропов. Каталог кинороликов для кинетоскопа, насчитывавший в конце 1894 года 60 наименований, в основном состоял из фильмов о дрессированных животных, акробатах, танцах и борьбе. Все фильмы имели стандартную длину 50 футов и снимались с таким расчётом, чтобы сюжет мог быть склеен в кольцо, повторяясь бесконечно. В результате, аппарат за счёт многопетельного лентопротяжного тракта не требовал перезарядки. Одним из самых известных роликов стал «Танец Лои Фуллер», который считается первым в истории колоризованным фильмом. В июле 1894 года зафиксирован первый случай киноцензуры: владелец зала в Сан-Франциско был арестован на месяц за «неприличный киносеанс», во время которого демонстрировался фильм «Карменсита». Однако, подобные инциденты не помешали появлению роликов, специально отснятых для залов с табличкой «Только для мужчин»: в этих фильмах, пользовавшихся большим успехом, хористки задирали юбки, танцуя канкан.\")])\n},function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Проецирующий кинетоскоп\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nУспешная экспансия «Синематографа» сделала очевидной необходимость создания собственной технологии, позволяющей получать изображение на экране. Появившийся позднее «Мутоскоп», несмотря на сходный метод индивидуального просмотра через окуляр, оказался дешевле и удачнее кинетоскопа, предопределив его коммерческий провал. Поэтому, уже в 1895 году Эдисон под маркой «Витаско́п» (англ. Vitascope) начал продавать созданное Чарльзом Дженкинсоном (англ. Charles Francis Jenkins) и Томасом Арматом (англ. Thomas Armat) устройство для проекции фильмов на большие экраны. В процессе эксплуатации выявился ряд недостатков этих кинопроекторов, заставивших Эдисона предпринять усилия для собственных разработок. В результате с ноября 1896 года компания приступила к выпуску нового устройства для проекции фильмов «Проджектоскоп» (англ. Projectoscope).\\nВ 1912 году Эдисон выпустил на рынок «Проджектоскоп» для любительского использования в домашних условиях. На негорючей киноплёнке нового формата шириной 22-мм для такого проджектоскопа изображение располагалось на трёх дорожках кадров размером 4×6 мм. Проекция происходила последовательно с реверсом механизма: сначала при прямом ходе проецировался первый ряд, затем при обратном — второй, расположенный в середине, и в конце — третий снова в прямом направлении. Технология не получила распространения, уступая в удобстве появившимся двумя годами ранее 28-мм любительским проекторам «Pathé KOK». Через четыре года компания Эдисона вышла на рынок со своей последней технологией кинопроекции «Супер Кинетоскоп», так же не получившей распространения из-за жёсткой конкуренции с более удачными проекторами.\")])\n},function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Кинетофон\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nИдея создания устройства, способного воспроизводить звук одновременно с изображением, появилась раньше, чем начались разработки кинетографа и кинетоскопа, задуманных Эдисоном, как приставка к изобретённому им ранее фонографу. В 1894 году он писал:\\n\\nВ 1887 году мне пришла мысль о возможности сконструировать аппарат, который будет для зрения тем же, чем является фонограф для слуха, и который будет и записывать и воспроизводить одновременно звук и движение\\n\\nВ марте 1895 года завершено создание аппарата, представляющего из себя помещённые в один корпус кинетоскоп и фонограф с общим приводом лентопротяжного механизма и звукового цилиндра под названием «Кинетофон» (англ. kinetophone)[17]. Первым известным звуковым фильмом является снятая в 1894 году или в самом начале 1895 года на студии Эдисона в Уэст-Орандже запись, ныне известная как «Экспериментальный звуковой фильм Диксона». Синхронная съёмка фильмов для кинетофона была затруднена по многим причинам, главными из которых были низкая чувствительность мембраны фонографа и необходимость использования громоздких рупоров, неизбежно видимых в кадре, как в упомянутом фильме. Точность синхронизации оставалась низкой, исключая совпадение артикуляции с речевой фонограммой. Поэтому большинство звуковых кинороликов представляли собой ритмические действия, происходящие под музыку, записанную отдельно от изображения. Демонстраторы могли подобрать к каждому фильму звуковое сопровождение из широкого спектра поставлявшихся валиков фонографа, задавая подходящий темп. Невысокая громкость допускала только индивидуальное прослушивание звука через первые в мире внутриканальные наушники, что хорошо сочеталось с конструкцией кинетоскопа, но было неприемлемо при проекции на большой экран. В результате, кинетофон устарел одновременно с кинетоскопом, вытесненным с рынка кинопроекторами различных систем. Было выпущено не более двух-трёх дюжин аппаратов, не имевших коммерческого успеха.\\nДальнейшие попытки объединить изображение со звуком предпринимались уже с проецирующим кинетоскопом. В 1913 году технология была продемонстрирована за пределами США, в том числе в Москве и Санкт-Петербурге, где была встречена неоднозначно. Однако, на тот момент уже существовала аналогичная система звукового кино «Гомон Хронофон» компании Gaumont, использующая более современные грампластинки вместо устаревших валиков.\")])\n},function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Kinetoscope\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nThe Kinetoscope is an early motion picture exhibition device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window at the top of the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was copied by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892.[1] Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.\\nA prototype for the Kinetoscope was shown to a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope was held at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.\")])\n},function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('p', [_c('b', [_vm._v(\"Projecting Kinetoscopes\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\"\\nOver the course of 1895, it became clear that the Kinetoscope was going to lose out on one end to projected motion pictures and, on the other, to a new \\\"peep show\\\" device, the cheap, flip-book-based Mutoscope. In its second year of commercialization, the Kinetoscope operation's profits plummeted by more than 95 percent, to just over $4,000. The Latham brothers and their father, Woodville, had retained the services of former Edison employee Eugene Lauste and then, in April 1895, Dickson himself to develop a film projection system. On May 20, in New York City, the new Eidoloscope was used for the first commercial screening of a motion picture: a boxing match between Young Griffo and Charles Barnett, four or eight minutes long. European inventors, most prominently the Lumières and Germany's Skladanowsky brothers, were moving forward with similar systems.\\nBy the beginning of 1896, Edison had turned his attention to promoting a projector technology, the Phantoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator.  With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals. \\nAs far back as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had screened films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; in the style of the Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of The Great Train Robbery (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.\")])\n}]}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/vue-loader/lib/template-compiler.js?id=data-v-7f48eddc!./~/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=template&index=0!./src/views/events/Kinetoscope.vue\n// module id = 110\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports={render:function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"container--center\"\n  }, [_c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"wrapper\"\n  }, [_c('c-header', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"title\": ['Люди', 'People'],\n      \"oq\": true\n    }\n  }), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('router-view')])])\n},staticRenderFns: []}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/vue-loader/lib/template-compiler.js?id=data-v-942e65c0!./~/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=template&index=0!./src/views/People.vue\n// module id = 111\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports={render:function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"container--center\"\n  }, [_c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"wrapper\"\n  }, [_c('c-header', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"title\": null,\n      \"oq\": true\n    }\n  }), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"layer\"\n  }, [_c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"double-text\"\n  }, [_c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"double-text__black\"\n  }, [_c('router-link', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"to\": \"/cinema\"\n    }\n  }, [_vm._v(\"Кино\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('router-link', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"to\": \"/people/index\"\n    }\n  }, [_vm._v(\"Люди\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('router-link', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"to\": \"/events/index\"\n    }\n  }, [_vm._v(\"События\")]), _c('br')]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"double-text__blue\"\n  }, [_c('router-link', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"to\": \"/cinema\"\n    }\n  }, [_vm._v(\"Cinema\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('router-link', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"to\": \"/people/index\"\n    }\n  }, [_vm._v(\"People\")]), _c('br'), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('router-link', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"to\": \"/events/index\"\n    }\n  }, [_vm._v(\"Events\")]), _c('br')])])])])])\n},staticRenderFns: []}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/vue-loader/lib/template-compiler.js?id=data-v-ac0d5ba0!./~/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=template&index=0!./src/views/Menu.vue\n// module id = 112\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports={render:function (){var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._c;\n  return _c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"container--center\"\n  }, [_c('div', {\n    staticClass: \"wrapper\"\n  }, [_c('c-header', {\n    attrs: {\n      \"title\": ['События', 'Events'],\n      \"oq\": true\n    }\n  }), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('router-view')])])\n},staticRenderFns: []}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/vue-loader/lib/template-compiler.js?id=data-v-b5bfb2ac!./~/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=template&index=0!./src/views/Events.vue\n// module id = 113\n// module chunks = 0","// style-loader: Adds some css to the DOM by adding a <style> tag\n\n// load the styles\nvar content = require(\"!!./../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!./../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/style-rewriter.js?id=data-v-02560cdf&scoped=true!./../../../node_modules/sass-loader/index.js!./../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=styles&index=0!./Warner.vue\");\nif(typeof content === 'string') content = [[module.id, content, '']];\n// add the styles to the DOM\nvar update = require(\"!./../../../node_modules/vue-style-loader/addStyles.js\")(content, {});\nif(content.locals) module.exports = content.locals;\n// Hot Module Replacement\nif(module.hot) {\n\t// When the styles change, update the <style> tags\n\tif(!content.locals) {\n\t\tmodule.hot.accept(\"!!./../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!./../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/style-rewriter.js?id=data-v-02560cdf&scoped=true!./../../../node_modules/sass-loader/index.js!./../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=styles&index=0!./Warner.vue\", function() {\n\t\t\tvar newContent = require(\"!!./../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!./../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/style-rewriter.js?id=data-v-02560cdf&scoped=true!./../../../node_modules/sass-loader/index.js!./../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/selector.js?type=styles&index=0!./Warner.vue\");\n\t\t\tif(typeof newContent === 'string') newContent = [[module.id, newContent, '']];\n\t\t\tupdate(newContent);\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\t// When the module is disposed, remove the <style> tags\n\tmodule.hot.dispose(function() { update();
